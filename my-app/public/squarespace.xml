  <h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’ve never been someone who gets it on the first try.</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I try and make up for that by being overly enthusiastic about almost all that I do. When I decided to explore the foundations and implications of Rome, I ended up performing better on my Latin tests. I was genuinely interested.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Now, to test that theory––if I can elevate, even romanticize, my life, could that improve my daily mindset?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I decided to take a gap year two weeks before Duke University wanted us to come to campus. This summer, while I was supposed to be in Greece working on a Classical Archaeology dig, I refused to stay idle. I signed up for EMT-B classes, and to say the least, studied harder than I ever have before; this time, what I read in the textbook felt more real than ever.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I deliberated quite a bit on whether I wanted to spend a whole year taking a “break,” as I’ve never been one to slow down. But this isn’t slowing down. Instead, I am refocusing my camera lens. I am grabbing a bag of popcorn only to grab the remote and hit play again.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And such, to document the pauses of this year, the empty spaces, the late night ambulance runs, and odd road trips, I’ll be making my year quite transparent. This is a pause––but not an idle one.</p>

As most of my friends are starting to move in and begin their freshman year, I’m feeling the pressure to be busy. I spend many nights after midnight applying to random jobs on Indeed. I got a call back from a drug-testing agency who turned me down because the job wasn’t stimulating enough, and yet, the jobs I do want to work for say that I’m not qualified enough.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I am chugging along the process of becoming a certified EMT-B.

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I also met someone who works in the field of emergency medicine, and she was at the beginning of her registry. This isn’t the most luxurious field of medicine with odd long nights, maggots in legs, and decapitated drivers. One of the hopes of this year is that I can figure out if medical school is the choice for me. A curveball that has hit me this year is that the process of being an EMT-B requires sitting in others’ inboxes, reminding them that this is the next barrier for you. The process accelerates and comes to quick halts before I can even find my footing. Next up is oral boards, which is basically an RPG medicine simulator, then clinicals. Usually, clinicals would last six weeks, but they’ll be virtual and accelerated because of COVID. I am hoping that I will be nationally registered by the end of September.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">One of the other things I’m investigating is Paramedic school. My local community college offers a 6.5 month course, but it’s fairly intensive. The only pre-requisite is that I have my NREMT…which is again time dependent.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I took a trip to Austin before I even finished packing. My OCD has created new turning points in my life, and I realized that I’d been cooped up for far too long. After the three-hour drive, I spent a bunch of amazing time with my uncle, who helped me build our chicken coop. We wanted something for a few more chickens––just in case. I had collected a bunch of doodles of my ideas of mechanisms I thought would be cool for a coop to have, and we made it happen. He’ll be coming down around Labor Day weekend to help us reassemble it.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It has been weird watching schools reopen. When I was committing to going this fall, I woke up every morning praying that all schools would operate as normal. Now that I don’t have the same connection, I’ve found myself to become much more worried about the well-being of the students. My mom and I think that Duke will last a month in person. Exeter starts again too, and I just hope students realize that education is not only in the classroom. It is real life experience. That’s what I’m trying to believe.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I am hoping to go back to open-mic nights again. My favorite place has shut down their show, but a few others are still open. Music makes me feel incognito in Dallas––I can pretend to be a tortured folk singer with no other worries.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Tutoring has been an unexpected joy. At first, I started it to turn my obsession with school into an employable skill, but it’s become something I look forward to every day.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’ll be taking General Physics and Calculus at SMU. I’m excited to have a bit of structure again––I just want to make sure I don’t automatically overload.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Here’s my ideal: going to class on Tuesdays and Thursdays, doing a few coffee shifts, and doing three 12-hour EMT shifts a week. It’ll add up, I’m sure. I’ve gotten hired at Scooter’s Coffee, along with interviewing with Paper Source (which I hope will work out)!</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’ve already learned so much about this self-navigated journey. I am learning to be more patient with myself and trust myself––just because there is a test coming up does not mean I will fail it. I’ve found ways to lean into my instinct, fail more, and send a whole lot of emails. I would try and be deep and reflective here, but it feels like that’s for another time.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Until next.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Alex</p>

  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Places I’ve been:</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dallas, TX</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This month has felt the same as August––which is something I was worried about when I started this journey. I wanted each day to feel like a new, refreshing breath of air, but I’ve found myself creating quite the opposite environment.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I think one of the things I’ve learned already is that I’m addicted to working. Not the quality of working or the satisfaction of working, but rather, I feel like being busy somehow translates to success. I have to admit––I am nowhere near finding a balance for myself. One of my new fears is feeling more burnt out after this “gap year” than I felt after graduating. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It's been odd talking to friends who are now starting their freshman year of college, repeating the joy of our prep year. But we're in more of a similar situation than I expected: the troubles of finding friends, routine, and community. I can empathize with them with online learning as well. I'm taking three classes at SMU and one at Dallas College, all of which are online. I started the year on the right foot at SMU, forcing myself to go to the library on the days that I had classes to feel like a real student, despite using Google Maps to get there each time. That usually happens on Tuesdays, but on Thursdays, I feel drained, unmotivated, and lost.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Of course, failing my first physics test didn't help. I'm not talking about "darn, a 92, I could have done better." No––I'm talking a 46 out of 100. I weirdly expected this. Of course, not the grade, but I've avoided physics for so long because something about it always intimidated me. I'm not the greatest math student (which, however, doesn't mean I don't enjoy it), and I knew that conceptualizing pushing a boulder up a hill outside of a philosophical text would put me at the bottom.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It's been two weeks since I've found out about the test, and I've vaguely gone over it again, afraid to really sink my teeth in as a sign of failure. I mentioned this to my mom today, and she reminded me of my rationale to do this in the first place: I won't have to take it at Duke, and it will have no bearing on my GPA. And, not to mention, my professor drops the lowest test. Regardless, I'm feeling like a 46.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I love my coffee job, all for reasons that should be counteracted by the negatives. I'm paid $9 an hour, it's thirty minutes away, and it's an only-drive-thru location with approximately 50 square feet. I love the attention to detail when making drinks, the regulars who want half non-fat milk and half almond milk, the quick social interactions at the window before they're off to live their own bubbles. I love the people, most of whom are oddly studying psychology at Collin. It's the first time in a while I've I feel confident doing something alone, unprompted and unguided.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I also love driving down the tollway at 5:30 am. No one is there, yet the cars seem to give each other subtle nods: "Yeah, we're in this together. I get it, man."</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">One of the pitfalls of this month has been Clinicals. After passing my oral boards (which are basically glorified medical D&amp;D games), I was cleared to start them. I scheduled them all back to back, pushing back my work schedule to get them out of the way so that I could find consistency again. All the paperwork on my end is completed, but the school I took EMT classes with which was supposed to set me up for a background test and drug test has fallen through. Two weeks of emailing, "did you get it?" followed by replies of "no, try it again?" But maybe the email tag buffer is a reminder that there is no rush to get on an ambulance. I have a year. Anyways, it's looking like the best-case scenario is mid-October, running 6 ambulance shifts with Acadian Ambulance and 2 hospital shifts at Medical City.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I like the idea of Paramedic school, but it's about time. Do I have time for 42-credit hours this year, over three semesters, squeezed between flex-mesters, summers, or any day that a professor will teach me? Regardless, I know my primary focus should be SMU since those are the courses that impact Duke. The only problem is that I love my medical classes so much more.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Honor Bar and I have a love-hate relationship. It's the opposite of Scooter's––it would make me far more money than I know how to spend, it's two minutes from my house, and would look much better on a resume. The only problem is that it's more stressful than my physics class. I arrive an hour before my shift for a test every day, whether it's over appetizers or their entire liquor collection. The problem is that I start seeing myself from others' shoes in that job––I wonder what I look like walking, wonder if my hair is "spec" enough. They love the word spec; context clues have led me to believe it's a bit above the standard, which, in turn, becomes the standard. I got a haircut for them, raided a Dillard's, but I still don't feel like I fit in. I'm definitely the youngest and most anxious person there, and they don't hold back in the name of politeness. It's about the guest, not you. I would say that I expected that part of the job, but I would be lying if I said that I expected this level of harshness. One minute, you're getting yelled at in Expo for drinking water, and the next, you walk to a guest's table with the brightest smile on your face (and it has to be wide enough for them to see you "smize," since masks have ruined most of our pleasantries). I'm almost done with training, and I hope that I'll feel like I can stand up a bit more for myself, maybe even stand up a bit straighter once this passes. As easy as it would be to quit, I want to stick through it past training, see if I like the weight of my wallet and emotional baggage, then decide from there. I'm hoping to start taking it as a critique on Alex the Mannequin rather than the Person.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I do think I use busy-ness as a coping mechanism. I had a wonderful conversation with a friend a few days ago who has requested to go by Anonymous Capybara. (Very funny.) The root of the question was: do depression and nihilism go directly hand-in-hand? Does the search for a "purpose" act as a pretense for creating meaning? I've never been one to believe that there is One True Purpose, and as a sucker for Kierkegaard, I believe each person's truth is subjective.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The problem is this: we see our future selves as completely different people. "Oh, my tomorrow self will have had an awakening and will want to write this paper, so I'll do it then." But it never works like that, and we always end up being disappointed. We are so, so, so bad at predicting the future. You apply to college, get into your dream school, celebrate for a few days, but after that, you're back to the muck of: why? You should be proud rationally, but something counteracts that, and you end up in the irrational pool regardless. So then, what is a purpose or goal that&nbsp;<em>isn't</em>&nbsp;short-term fulfillment? A perception that has benefiting qualities when you aren't sitting in an office, aren't clocked in––even will help you get out of bed after staring at the ceiling? I don't, or rather, we don't think that a purpose centered around your self-image or goals can do that––you'll always, always be disappointed, always find a way to undercut your success and achievements. I brought up the example of people I consider more stable than two 18-year olds: parents. Sure, part of their purpose can be career or future based, but oftentimes their goals are oriented around their kids. Since they don't live in their kids' heads, they're finally able to experience the satisfaction of seeing that third-person entity succeed without the oozing neutrality that the first-person brings. Maybe that's why I want to be an EMT. The other problem?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">These definitions of purpose are selfish––even the selfless ones; I'm rationalizing that your meaning of life should be centered around other people because it doesn't carry the same weight of doubt. (Although, if all purpose is selfish, maybe this is a little more selfless compared to the "be happy" truths. Who am I to say? It's subjective.)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Until next,</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Alex</p>

Strangers who work jobs I’d only seen the outsides of––the siren of an ambulance, the humming of servers as I ate at Hillstone Restaurants, the grinding of the coffee machine as I waited in the drive-thru. I didn’t think these stories were special enough to write about or explore truly; I went for the more obvious obscure. The gods and ancient heroes who had their history written already. I wrote this in December of 2019:</p><p style="margin-left:80px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">“I think I’m obsessed with the ancients because their stories have been told, and will continue to be told, for thousands of years. There’s something concrete about this legacy of the oldest myths and folklore; their worth and what they have amounted to has already been solidified. There’s no question that they are glorified through the manuscripts and Percy Jackson books. They got lucky.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Of course, they got lucky; it’s why myth and folklore remain the focus of so many of our modern-day literature. And for a long time, I was focused on how I could even be close to the myth of the ancients––how could I find a crevice in history to fit into when there was so much else to be remembered?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I have already forgotten most of this year. I spend most nights on the call with a particular friend, and at least once a night, he says, “Did I tell you about…?” My response is always, “I don’t remember.” It’s not that I’m not listening. I feel present in those moments; the stories and plots feel enveloping when the call continues. But when I hang up the phone, I move on. I close the door, lock it, and get onto the next scheduled activity. These myths are similar––we remember them when we want to, only when there’s a significant figurative connection to our own lives. In truth, when we see ourselves or our story in theirs.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This is all to say that I have been focused a lot on the macro of this year. I continue to ask myself: what will be my answer when someone asks, “What did you do with your gap year?” Some took a ski trip, a retreat, or spent time with family. I want my answer to be that I have spent this year meeting strangers, just as I have met thousands through literature. But these strangers are real, empathetic, joyful, persevering people. There isn’t the convenience of a Deus Machina, no hero’s journey to guide them to a gratifying ending. The rhetorical devices are what they make of them; the symbolism the same.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So how does working 40 hours a week through Honor Bar, coffee, and tutoring lead to that? That’s the issue I’m contemplating. Not the quality of the work I’m doing, but the quantity. I know that I’m going to have to readjust once I start working as an EMT, but I have a while until then. I like the feeling of growing up, but I don’t want to grow up too fast. I want to find a happy medium between clueless and jaded.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I start clinicals, officially, on November 11th. I will be in uniform––head to toe in vomit and blood resistant material, donned with more PPE than I’ve ever worn. The nerves have subsided after months of waiting. Now, I want to begin. I want to meet more people who are crazy enough to put their own safety and wellbeing to the sidelines for the chance of saving someone’s story.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I also have to start thinking about a decision I’m going to have to make in January. Paramedic school runs from January 25th to August 10th, every weekday 7:30-16:00. I know that I would love paramedic school, every single late night of studying cardiology. But it’s time.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The time that I don’t have yet. Throughout that time, I have so many conflicts that would have to be shifted, contorted, or thrown out to commit. The nice thing is that the decision depends on how quickly I can get my NREMT, which could be anywhere from late November to the end of January. If it takes too long, I won’t be able to take the curriculum regardless.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I am not the greatest server at Honor Bar––in fact, I am far from it. I average 3.5 mistakes per 7-hour shift. I have a spreadsheet that details each, with both the cause and solution listed. It’s not that these things cannot be fixed, but it takes precious time. Rang in the Brownie Bites to the wrong table, but they haven’t been made yet? That’s fine, but spend the next six minutes fixing your mistake and writing a Comp while your Table 33 wonders if their server has forgotten about them. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I often feel like a small fish in a big pond. There was a bartender that was with Hillstone Restaurants for seven years––seven years. I don’t even know what growth over seven years looks like. Most people there have exit strategies, but some don’t. This is life for some people. And that’s not a bad thing––it’s a good one: good pay, honest community, supportive management, and fascinating people-watching. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I will probably not be a server for the rest of my life. I, hopefully, will end up in academia, a hospital, or an archaeology site. However, there is a common thread––I will always be working at least 40 hours a week. I love the feeling of shifting meetings into 30-minute crevices, getting home far too late or waking up far too early. I will always make mistakes, both big and small, regardless of what field I end up in. I will have to find a way to make the most of those six minutes.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you’re one of the strangers I’ve met reading this, I hope you know that I no longer consider you a stranger. I am entirely on your side: I want to know your ups and downs, highs, and lows. That is what will make this year special.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Also, in re: Mechanics test, I took my second midterm for the class on October 22nd. I have yet to get the grade back, but I couldn’t be less worried. I know I got higher than a 46, not because I knew every nuance of the material, but because I felt that each argument I made on paper was to the best of my ability. I love that bubble too. Students who are all mumbling about how hard their classes are, bumbling along from building to building, Zoom to Zoom. I’m excited about that future, but now I notice moments where my old self would have fallen to the floor in despair.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This is small, which somehow makes it big. Not to mythologize my own life, but I left my wallet at home after a long shift before my Mechanics Lab. Problem: I need my SMU ID to enter the library for my Zoom class. So instead of crying in my car, wallowing in my own stupidity, I went into Expo and did something with my six minutes. I hopped into the Zoom call in a Tom Thumb parking lot and solved the hell out of that physics problem. No one asked questions about where I was or what mess I had gotten myself into this time; we were all worried about the maximum height a skier could reach after leaving the ice with a low friction coefficient.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I hope to see more things in scale next month. I hope to do more with my six minutes. It’s not personal; it’s business.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Until next month,</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Alex</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">John* was just arrested for violating his probation––by robbing a local store. His previous charge? Drug possession.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">John was young, dressed in clothes that I would wear, and sitting on the pavement next to the cop car.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Hi my name is Dave*, and I’ll be the medic taking care of you today along with my student Alex. What’s going on?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">John looked at me and said nothing.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It was my first call of that shift, around 9 in the morning. For the first thirty minutes of the call, all John did was mumble and look at me. It took me until the second glance to realize why he might be so absent.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I grabbed my pen light and looked at his pupils––pinpoint. From my textbooks, that meant he was using opiates.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">My medic preceptor stepped away to talk to the cops, and I kneeled down next to John, checking his vitals and overall condition.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“John, have you taken any substances in the past 12 hours?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He looked at me for a minute before responding. I swear he didn’t blink.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Morning, meth. Store, 3 Xanax. After, heroin.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The medic overheard him speaking and came over. He started looking for injection sites, but John’s arms were clean.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“John, did you inject the heroin in your leg?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Another minute passed. “Swallowed.”</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">***</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He said “I wish I could start over again” as we took him off of the floor and loaded him into the ambulance.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I rode with John for the twenty minute ambulance ride. He continued to try and talk, but he couldn’t get a word out. Our assumption was that he swallowed the heroin to avoid another drug charge. While we didn’t do anything in the ambulance since he wasn’t critical, we knew what would happen to him when he got to the hospital. A whole lot of activated charcoal and, to say it nicely, emesis.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This month, I saw more real things than I have ever seen in my life. A suicide attempt, an alzheimer’s patient, an alcoholic; and somehow I saw myself or my peers in all of them. One of them, the alcoholic, showed my pictures of her addiction, and praised me throughout the ride for “being on a good path, unlike [her].”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">That raises a new question: where exactly did they turn that I haven’t, or won’t? What could they have done before that they didn’t?<br></p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I finished the first semester better than I thought I would; it already puts me at a head start for Duke. But more than that, I feel like I’m better fit to understand what Duke means for me. It feels like a stepping stone.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Another excerpt from a late night conversation: prestige is the expectation of success. It means that everyone expects you to be successful rather than the promise of success. I know that I can work hard at whatever I’m aiming towards next; my ambition is not the fear. The fear is direction––how do I know that I’m working towards the right future for myself? One that works for me instead of me working for it? I want the satisfying moments: helping someone back up, teaching someone a concept that they’ve been trying to wrap their head around for weeks, having conversations that are mutually beneficial and curiosity inciting; the moments of a do-er.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I can’t credit the word do-er; it’s a term used often by a close friend of mine. Someone who spends their time doing the real stuff and having a real impact rather than just a title or social prestige. I don’t think I know anyone who I would consider a “do-er,” but I know a few people who come close. My mom, for example.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">My mom has always said that each person has seven careers in their lifetime. This is an estimation, but I’m pretty sure she’s on career number 5. Five times, she looked at her stable position doing something she loved, and she said “let’s try something else.” That’s a do-er mentality; seeing a challenge and choosing it over comfort.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The problem is that I enjoy comfort. Between soul crushing weeks and all-nighters, I take naps, play a few runthroughs of Hades, and watch YouTube. I spend five days of the week looking forward to the two that I have no commitments during; as if I’m in elementary school waiting for Friday to come.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It’s not that I don’t enjoy my days at work; I’m surrounded by smart, driven, and diligent people. People I love talking to, dreaming with, and hoping towards. But there’s always relief in the last few hours as I finish up my last six-high of sticks.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">That’s what the future means for me. I hope, and this is a far-fetched dream hidden at the bottom of the sea, that I find a lifestyle that leads to me to look forward to the five days of the week. I like the structure of it, even the content, but the fact that it’s called work makes me feel like I have to be working towards someone else rather than myself. The 37 hours I’m working don’t directly quantitatively direct to personal growth. But the 100 hours do.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">That mindset shift may never happen. For now, I’ll clock in and clock out.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I left my coffee job, and I’ll hopefully start a new one soon. Financially, it didn’t make sense to continue that particular job. More to come.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I take my NREMT on January 13th, two weeks from today. From there, it means a whole new schedule, a whole new perspective of leadership and burden. Not only for the company I’m working for, but for the people I’m caring for.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’ll be working both on New Year’s and New Year’s Eve this year, but I still plan on a few resolutions. Here’s a list:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Do one thing every single day. Brew coffee, make my bed, write, read.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Be ahead of classes instead of letting them be ahead of you.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Stop asking “are you sure?”</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And, on that note, stop apologizing after every sentence.</p></li></ol></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Travel outside of the country; Greece?</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Spend more time learning.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Release those albums.</p></li></ol><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">No working out or eating healthy resolutions; I know that’s out of my capability.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I have no clue who I want to be a year from now. I don’t know if I want to go to medical school, pursue Classics, or spend my life traveling with a trowel; even scarier, something I don’t even know yet. However, I know my trends. I know that I gravitate towards challenges and things I think are impossible.&nbsp;</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Here’s to impossible, whatever that may mean.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Best,</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Alex</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br><br><br></p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It's not that I don't know where I'm going. I know that I want to be a great like I've always thought.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Every piece of silverware that goes through represents, to an uncertain extent, a guest. Usually, knives are more reliable, as they are used less often on appetizers. More often, they'll drop a fork on the floor. I roll, on average, around 287 sticks a day. A "stick" is a pair of fork and knife, wrapped into a cylinder of linen. According to a few days of timing myself with the wall clock, a "six-high," a stack of 6x6 sticks, takes around 8 minutes. So, 20 seconds a stick. I've divided it into 8 steps.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1. Check the side of the linen. The inside of the linen must be facing toward you for it to be "spec." 2. Fold the square linen roughly in half in a triangle fashion, aiming for an inch distance from the topmost tip to the inner tip. Make sure the sides are parallel. If there is any discoloration in the linen, it's called "credit." This also includes things like tears, lint, loss of fabric, or thinning. 3. Grab your fork and knife, which you've already polished with water and distilled white vinegar. If there are any water stains or severe damage to the utensil, discard it. Then place your fork and knife in such an order: knife, with the edge facing the top of the linen, then fork on top. Make sure the fork is stable without extreme pressure. Make sure that your utensil pair lines up with the linen's top with an equal amount of the knife on either side. You can use the midpoint of the knife as a reference.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">4. Begin folding. Hold your right hand on the pair of utensils to keep them stable, and push the fork to the left as you pull the left side of the linen with slight pressure. As you drop the linen's left side onto the right, the utensils should remain on top of each other. Reposition your right hand to control the linen by moving it on top.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">5. Right side. Pull the right side of the utensils into the right side of the linen, securing its place. Once you've got something that looks like an envelope, we're onto 6. Roll up, ensuring the sides are parallel and pressure is kept. 7, readjust. Once you roll the stick into its cylinder, you're sure to have some overhang or loss of pressure. Rollback, then roll up, holding the top corner. 8, place in the same angle as the other sticks on the six-high; your six-high should look like a box rather than a lopsided tower. Sticks should be the same length and width.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And that's most of my day. I'll roll out 1 or 2 six-highs, do all the other things people ask me to do, then wait for the next round of silver so I can go through the entire process again. It's very sisyphusesque: creating a product that has gone so many times around the restaurant's circular frame. I mean, we probably have something like 125 fork and knife pairs; 108 sticks should be on display for wipe-sets, basically bussing and setting the table, at all times. One by the Greeter's Stand, one by the linen cabinet, and one on the patio. The others are on the floor, and I wait for people to finish their meal, with a high enough restaurant volume for the hour, and roll.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It reminds me of&nbsp;<em>Zorba the Greek</em>; “I like to get tired, to sweat, to hear my bones creak. I despise money, throw it away, squander it wherever and however it thoughtlessly enters my head to do. I’m not a slave to lucre; lucre is a slave to me. On my honor, I’m a slave to work.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">My NREMT is rapidly approaching, and I feel like a fool. It's not that I don't know the material or even that I'm not capable of knowing the material; the problem is beginning. This test answers a lot of questions about the next six months. If I find a job as an EMT that conflicts with my Honor Bar schedule, is it worth it? Would I be killing my future by losing the extra 6 months of savings, or would I be missing out on the value that I was truly supposed to learn there?&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">[Between these excerpts, I proceeded to fail my NREMT.]</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Today, I brought our cedar plank roasted salmon to the CEO, whose worth has been evaluated at 4.5 billion dollars. My hands were a bit shaky, but: I spend my day surrounded by millionaires on the floor--investment bankers, medical professionals, consultants, drug dealers, basketball players--and I feel so far away from them. I think I can, and will, own at least a scale of that wealth in my lifetime, but I worry that I'm entirely alien to them. I feel like I've been watching my life in the third person for the past month, wondering.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I have yet to face the failure of my NREMT truly. I'm definitely a different person--I can tell because I'm not panicked. I'm not afraid that the future might outrun me; rather, we are walking side-by-side (perhaps, more accurately, the future is dragging me behind it with its short leash). I want to think that I am open and eager for change, but I think I am far more comfortable with comfort than I realized. I don't mind taking a day or two off, looking for ten-minute breaks throughout the day. The question becomes: what is it that I am doing during those brief suspensions of normal obligation?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I envision spaces in quite a different way than I occupy them. Archaeology is about the exploration of curiosity; working in a restaurant is executing regardless of the question. I wanted to be the explorer, never stopping at one question until it leads me to another, but when I'm working with my neck bent over a table, folding the same mundane sticks of silverware, I worry that I have lost the first impulse to ask, "why?" Maybe the money breaches some barrier that allows me to turn off my unbridled hope for the future, keeping me in place and position in the present.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I'm not a dreamer. I want to do and be things that I have not been or done yet, but that doesn't make me a dreamer. I have no idea of who or what that would look like; I have no idea what kind or what degree of success brings about the life I want. I think I value my life differently than others around me. While others might be dreamers of the most vivid degree, I worry more about how I will process thoughts than those thoughts.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Here's to worry; although I will do it regardless.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Best,</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Alex</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br></p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Why do we do things that harm us? Why do we poison ourselves with alcohol, steep heights, terrifying beats that come out far past the sunset? </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It's because we are Skinner's pigeons. If you leave us in the box enough, we will press the dot, and food shall come. What we often forget to realize is that if the pigeon had just waited patiently in the box for just long enough, the food would come regardless of our medial pecking. But to wait in the box staring at the wall is the patience of a lifetime. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When I was younger, I danced. Tap, ballet, jazz, whatever would keep me moving. I wouldn't say I liked it, but I had friends, a community, and most importantly, I had rituals there.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I danced for about three years. Every six weeks or so, we would have a concert. Twenty six-year-olds dressed to the nines (which mostly meant hair in a bun on the rare occasion). But for me, I loved the concerts more than anything else. Why?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">After each one, my parents would bring flowers, seeping with a saturation of somewhere else. Flowers I could never find in a field, in a yard, by the creek. New flowers, illuminating strawberry roses. I would come home, wash off the spotlight and hairspray, and manicure the flowers for a home in our home. I knew they would die. So I would wait until the next concert to get them.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In the last year of dance, I told my mother how much I loved the flowers. She chuckled, looked down at her feet, and said, "We can get flowers whenever you would like, sweetie. They sell them around town."</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I quit dance the week or so after. The dance, while exhilarating, was not where the flowers were coming from. The flowers came from the shop we drove past on the way to school; they were not new, not from a place I could never dream of visiting.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We are awful at patience. We set hundreds of goals that we fail to acknowledge. We poison ourselves with late nights, junk food, and patience.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">All of this is to say that I am drunk on patience. I have minimal time; I ration out when to send one email when to wait for another. But I am patient. I am not rushing to the finish line; this is the part of the race that I find most exciting.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">But we don't mind illness; we don't mind poor health; we don't mind compulsions if it means a lifetime of drunkenness. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I will wait. The problem becomes that I don't know how I will know the waiting is done; no toll of the bell or melted wax seal waiting for me on the "other side" in another world. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I have loved being an advocate for Kierkegaard's philosophy. While he would be considered a depressed teenager obsessed with individualized nihilism in the modern-day, I can identify with that quite strongly. Of all of his writings, here is a highlight: truth is subjective. This seems counterintuitive at first; what is truth BUT objective? Soren means that each person should have an interpretation of religion instead of a large systematic faith.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I want to add an addendum to "truth is subjective." I think that not only my truth but each truth is subjective. When I see a rock, and you see a rock, we will describe the rock differently. Same rock, different truths. This, of course, comes with more limitations. This means that if I assume my truth always differs from yours or any other's, I can no longer trust other sources of truth. But that leads to an arduous life; how can I expect to be the truth-seeker in all areas of my life? </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Yesterday, when I was driving running errands, I kept looking back through my dashboard mirror and seeing faces. Face that I will probably never see again. I don't mind that, but the scarier idea is that I see them again but fail to recognize them.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I am reading a book lent to me by a coworker (who, if reading this, should know that they are a large part of my motivation to work each day) about neurological disorders. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">One of the stories is about a man who cannot remember past 1942 or so. It's not that he remembers 1942 as 1942; he remembers it as the most recent present imaginable. He sees himself in the mirror, much older than he was in 1942, and accuses everyone around him of pulling a trick. Here is the point: without a present, without a past (that remains in the past), and without a future that recalls on the past and builds upon it, what remains?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The author asks if he is hurting.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">"Are you miserable?"</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">"Can't say that I am."</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">"Do you enjoy life?"</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">"Can't say that I do."</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I have so much ahead. But I am afraid of the future, and for the first time in a while, failure. I am afraid to retake my NREMT; I am afraid to book a trip to New York, I am afraid to find details about the archaeology trip this summer. I am scared because this pandemic has me feeling like 1942. My memories that feel real are all from January 2020 and earlier. That's not to say I haven't grown; however, I have no baseline to compare myself to my past. I look in the mirror, and I am surprised that a year has passed. It was not the worst year, all things considered. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I am making my own truth because there is no future to propel the past forward; there is a catalyst for change when recycled like scrapbook paper.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I can buy flowers from any grocery store, from roses to tulips, to my favorite orchids. But I have not ever bought flowers, for myself or someone else. Without the impending feeling of performance, there isn't splendor for the mundane of high buns and tights. The mundane becomes valuable when we are surrounded by the exceptional; when I am around some of the brightest in the world, I look forward to trudging through the snow to make a cup of tea on the fourth floor of my dorm to find only my mess. A pigeon a million worlds away, in a world I am now afraid of entering. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Confidence is not an emotion. Confidence is a filter, a presence mostly put on by those in authority or interviews; managers, executives--blatantly put, important people. My dad, especially, exudes unearthly confidence, and he can back it up with the utmost stubbornness. In this sense, I am jealous of him. My work is underlined by confidence: ensuring the guest thinks you know what you're doing in their best interest. The employees and managers who have been there the longest do it best. It's a smile the minute they approach the door; it's a genuine greeting. It's remembering someone who came into the restaurant a week ago and asking how their Shrimp Louis was.                                                                                                                                  </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Last night, due to the weather in Texas, the pipe above my bedroom broke. I've often seen the questions: what would you save in a fire. The first thing I went for? Paper. Letters, notes, books, and other miscellaneous parchments that I've been collecting my whole life. Friendships that I don't remember, camp friends writing letters about the world I never knew, old romantic relationships dwindling on paper, and letters from grandma. I'll be living in the guest room for the time being, and I've been mostly in hibernation since it's happened. The school has been canceled for the week, but work is still on.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I've moved many times within my own house. I lived in a bunk bed for most of my life; even when Emma, my older sister, outgrew it, I still kept both bunks. In the middle of Exeter, we finished a renovation on our house, and I moved to a new guest room. Now, I'm in (another) guest room. I feel, more than I ever have, which isn't saying much, that home feels like home. At Exeter, it felt like an interim, but after spending a year here, I know the house's routines, the familiar and the foreign. Am I a productive member of the house? Not quite. I live there as a college student who stays during vacation. I do the dishes, clean up after myself, but I rarely make the venture downstairs except to eat. I'm tired--perpetually tired. If I don't have anything on my agenda for that day, I will sleep. It never feels excessive; I feel refreshed after. This was the case at Exeter, too, but I had a much more full schedule.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I will be taking my NREMT the second week of March. I have decided, and I have committed myself to that timeline. If I pass, great; if not, more time to work. But I refuse to let this year pass without a certification under my belt. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We are not living alone. We are living with contractors, with insurance agents, with jackhammers and measuring tapes. We had a renovation a few years ago; I remember this feeling, but I don't remember feeling like such a stranger. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I got a poster today chronicling all of the weeks that I have lived and will live. I'm not even past the first fifth--I'm in the exposition of my novel. So, I raise the question: when does the rising action begin?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">But we're not like novels; we are not like the dear films we love so much. As much as I would like to believe, we are not stories, and sometimes, there is nothing to be told, as much as I would like to speak. I wish there were more to tell. I wish that my days were not only jam-packed with meetings and events but with symbolism, motif, litotes, and hendiadys. When s, I halt the rest of the momentum, and I make it a story--a story out of what was seemingly coincidence.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I am obsessive out of necessity. I am obsessive because when the mundane dissipates, I grasp the novelty's fragments (in both senses of the word). There's no crime in such "romanticizing," but it means that I'm searching and working for something unpredictable and with unknown value. Sometimes I have picked motifs; I have picked words and ideas and stories that I want to be acquainted with or attached to, but those are not the stories I find myself telling to friends a few months later. I am looking for the out-of-control observation of phenomena that make me feel like a detective--that make me feel like I have found something no one else has found before. Which, in turn, provides the illusion of legacy, but it's far more selfish than that. It's freedom.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I'm flipping light switches like you do your first night at a hotel--some of them have dimmers, some don't seem to do anything at all, and for some reason, the switch to the bedroom light is in the bathroom. I noticed the correlation between when covid started and what I feel had been an impossible world. I forget so often that I'm living in a pandemic. But I forgot that being a part of history means that you're the one who has to read about the last time we have faced such a burden, but in vain--we are growing so far out of our natural scale that we could never keep up if we tried. That's how we evolve; it might not seem as natural as so-called natural selection, but I think it's better to think of it as a practice. Skills that we practice often get better, features and tools and structures in society that aren't practiced, such as a coin, have obvious incentive to rid the scene and find a way to be within our Anthropocene scope of practice.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">With that, here’s a toast to repetition.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Best,</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Alex</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">For the larger part of my life before boarding school, I have lived on a busy neighborhood street, named after a bird. (I shall avoid the name of the street for privacy reasons.)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This street is near the middle school I went to; so close that I could in fact walk home. When I was in my later middle school years, I usually did. It was a routine that I usually hated: walking home in the 90 degree heat for even a few blocks was pitiful. I never wore short sleeves––I didn’t feel like a real person at that stage of my life. So I sweat the whole way.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">That wasn’t the only problem with walking home. I was terrible at actually going home. Sometimes we would walk to 7-11, stop by other’s places, and get into all sorts of trouble. It’s easy to say, looking back, that I was so unbearably lost that I clung onto the identity around me. I didn’t have the greatest taste in friends.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When I walk down that street now, I feel like the world is shorter. I haven't grown that much since I was living there, but I still feel like it was a million worlds away. I now work on that street––just a few blocks away.</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">***</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’ve picked up more shifts at Honor Bar; this week, I’m working 43 hours. That won’t be every week, but it’ll be more than my routine was accustomed to. I’ll be able to do it without much life interruption, but it means that the projects I was waiting to do when I was “less busy” are now happening at the same time.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I am recording at least 3 songs from my next album on March 10th. My writing process this year has been very erratic for songs––most of the time I pick up my guitar and write a full song from start to finish; other times I can only come up with a catchy chorus without any substance. I want to be a musician for the rest of my life––in fact, I don’t think I could stop if I tried. But my musical creative path is becoming jumbled. I was supposed to release an album in June at the end my senior year, but I pushed it off since I was putting all of my time and energy into <em>Metamorphoses: Myth into Songs</em>.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">But these songs have aged on me. While no one else has heard them, I’ve played them to myself a thousand times. My favorite song is always my newest, implying that the reason I like it is because it’s newer and different. I was proud of those songs six months ago, but I am quite dreading practicing them.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It makes me feel like I’m in 1942 all over again. Except with bigger goals and broader deadlines, which I set and can change.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I have been chugging through this semester, barely. Physics is a struggle as always, but I’m trying to be proactive about support and strategies.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It’s been a few weeks now, and there are still people roaming our halls fixing holes and ceilings. The difference is that now my schedule requires me to be up early––there’s no hiding in bed anymore. They moved the fans out, finally.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">For a week, no one could hear each other. Unless you were screaming, you had to be a maximum of one foot away from each other, directly yelling towards their face.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I got a heat blister yesterday from holding an absurdly hot plate. I don’t mind hot plates or burning glass anymore. I see it as more of a challenge. I’ve built up enough calluses from this job and playing guitar to make it through about 15 seconds before I start to really feel pain. Of course, I could wait until everything has cooled down, but by that point I’ll have twenty other things to do.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I find that I’m much more tolerant to pain than I have been in the past. When I was younger, I would cry if I got a papercut; I don’t know if I’m better at ignoring them because I’ve had hundreds, or if I don’t mind what pain the papercut could possibly cause.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Wittgenstein defined proprioception as a sense of ourselves; to feel our bodies as our own, A classic example of this is to be able to distinguish whether you’re standing on cement as opposed to grass.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I don’t know where I’m standing. I don’t know what I’m feeling, let alone what surface I’m standing on. If I knew what I was walking on, maybe I would know where I am. Or where I’m going.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I have a lot of fears that remain unresolved. I have a small sense of hope for this summer; the President claims all adults will be vaccinated by the end of May.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So does this end then? Texas just lifted its mask mandate––a bit recklessly,, I might add––and is now allowing 100% capacity. Does that mean my amnesia is over? Does this mean the present will be present, rather than an option that the circumstances lead me to?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This is not the gap year I anticipated. I have stayed busy, finding new passions and habits, all while living life around other people. But I think that this has been the best choice for me––regardless of obstacle.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’ve been saving every dollar I’ve made this year to invest. This is good for my future, but it provides something else: a backup plan.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Very few of my passions happen to be tied to lucrative careers. Most include living on a campus and working with a small team of people who are all curious and excited about something.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Everyone is trying to get out. My question isn’t why they want to get out––that becomes evident after 6 months of working there. But where to?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Do the servers who want to do real estate, the ones who want to go to medical school, to finance––do they see that as an ending? As a destination?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If anything, I see my possible futures as problems rather than conclusions. If I choose to educate, that means at least a Master’s doing something new and unique in a field that is older than I can imagine. If I choose medicine, there’s no way that I’m passing the MCAT. If I choose archaeology, I’ll spend around 6 years working on other digs before I even have entry level supervisor experience. Of course, if Greece can’t happen this year, I’ll have to wait until at least my sophomore year until my next dig, at which point I might change my mind entirely. I am finding myself anxious about planning because I don’t know who I’m planning for.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Have I changed that much over this year? Or do I think that I’ve changed because I need to justify the delay in my traditional education? Will this all remain in the fall? Will our lives feel like they're on hold until they hang up before we get a chance to start again?&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This year has been scratched from the record for many. But a year has never felt so short––I remember the day I was told I would not be graduating on campus, the day I said farewell to the few whom I had much more to say to, the day I made my last efforts to reach out to those who I wish I knew. I think I’m still trying to do that now.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I don’t regret anything about this year. I have adapted the time management skills of Exeter into the real, raunchy, world. But how much do I need to know about that world? Is it worth my time being adaptable if I have no need to adapt in the future?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I have mostly written questions up to this point; questions that I have yet to answer. Maybe I shouldn’t answer them––that must be part of the fun, then.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I have been building up the courage to ask for a raise at work. I’ve recited to myself why this makes sense––in fact, it makes plainly obvious sense. But I expect to walk into the office and be fired instead of given a raise. I always assume everyone above me––teachers, managers, coworkers––is not on my side.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">My mom reminded me of this recently. She has always been on my team––even when I disagreed with her strategies. I don’t think I’m always on my team, however.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I don’t often feel anger. I usually resort to fear, sadness, or disappointment before anger. But I must admit, I am angry that it has been a year of being a part of history. I am looking on the horizon, waiting for our “roaring twenties'' after the 1918 pandemic, but I’m so used to being let down that I can’t make plans for whenever normal returns to our world. I want to travel––to Arkansas, to New York, to Exeter, to Italy, and most of all, to Greece. More than ever, I miss not knowing when travelling––walking into a restaurant and not knowing what you’re going to order, driving streets that you’ve never driven before, meeting people you would never meet in your bubble of a neighborhood, or on your hometown street named after a bird.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I think I am angry because I don’t know what I lost. When it’s a bad grade, an argument with someone, or a missed opportunity, I know what I lost. I have no inkling of what this year would have been like if it just happened normally; and it might have been worse.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I panic when I lose my sense of choice. I can deal with uncertainty––as long as I have agency within the unpredictable. When that fails, I hibernate. Why be out taking risks in the middle of a flood?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I finished my 8th album today––a feat that sounds far more impressive on a resume than in reality. I love writing music; more than writing music, I love performing music. One of the things I miss the most is a coffee shop I used to perform at weekly in Summer ‘19. I would test song ideas, revise on the fly, duet with 40-something strangers.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’ve been to many open-mic nights. But I have met very few professional singer-songwriters. They’re all waiting to make it before they ditch their barista job; waiting on American Idol to give them a golden ticket; I don’t think that bargain is worth it for me.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Would I be a full-time musician if I could? Sure. Could I? No. I don’t write music proactively––it’s a coping mechanism, it’s a source of comfort––I would say that it’s analogous to rewatching the 6th season of a show you’ve seen so many times. It’s home, in an odd way.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’ve never been a phenomenal songwriter, partly due to the guise of “I’m not doing this for a career.” But do I not have a career? As of March 29th, I will have published 77 songs over my lifetime. Most were recorded in my closet with a microphone from Amazon, but this is my life history through music.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I never listen to my old music, and I often cringe when others put on the oldest tracks. In fact, I don’t listen to my music in front of anyone but my parents, who always have something to say. Recently, my dad noted that, “You don’t have a chorus.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Of course, as someone who has far more familiarity with the word chorus than my father does, I tried to oppose it. I showed him the repetition in the song, the three repeated stanzas.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“But I wouldn’t ever hear this on the radio. That’s not a bad thing. It’s poetry, not a song.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">My usual reply is that I don’t care about ever being on the radio, in re: “not taking this seriously.” But I agreed with him. I don’t think I would ever hear this on the radio, and this raises a potent question.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If, within the field of music, I have somehow made a niche (or I have just been making bad music) that is even more unlikely to result in a lucrative career, what does that say about this mentality towards other hobbies or aspirations of mine? Does writing music about Classics make it simply poetry, or does its uniqueness make it a lucrative asset? Is my writing useless without scale?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I am a selfish person––I’ve always admitted that. And while I know there are some people who do add these songs to playlists, I am far more concerned about the real business of life––legacy.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There are times that I look back on a release from a year ago and regret it. If only the guitar had been a bit quieter, if only I had added or removed some odd harmony, maybe then it would be better.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">But I’m in this for the marathon. I’m in this for recordkeeping. It’s another obsession––everything is chronicled in those songs. I’ve journalled most of my life, but there are gaps spanning years. But I couldn’t ever put down songwriting if I tried.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Of course, as the person living from my perspective, it’s quite easy to think that this is a one man act. (In connection to EXPOSITION.) Songs capture more than words do––not only am I recording what I want to say, but how I want to say it––with a major or minor chord, with a juxtaposing melody, with a whaling cry. There are many songs of mine that overlap, both in chords and key, but also in topic. From love, heartbreak, fear, hope, or desperation––but never from anger. That feeling has yet to be chronicled in this so-called encompassing record.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So, should I write an angry song? To whom? And, perhaps more importantly, for whom? Who exactly is it that I am so angry at?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">No one. I am angry at no one; but I am furious at the lack of entropy. I am furious at the lack of momentum. I am furious at the history books, at the billions of human bodies that are so susceptible to something so disruptive. It’s easy to forget that we’re just like all other beings––we have endings. We have finales, denouement, but no rising action or climax.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I want to be a force to be reckoned with. Do I eliminate that chance by refusing to change to the more potent product? Is this lack of ambition, or creatively driven stubbornness?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If I’m going to be writing poetry, I’m going to make sure it feels damn like poetry––every word will have a purpose, every story will have a tension.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I am a Nationally Ceritified EMT. Part of this is scary––looking around to make sure that no one made a mistake. Now it’s in my hands––the health and wellbeing of everyone who calls 911.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’ve only called EMS a few times in my life, but I remember each and every instance vividly. It’s odd to think that what is a once in a lifetime experience for some will the the daily routine for me––which comes twofold. I’ll be able to help people when they hit their lowest, but I’ll also be there when there isn’t anything I can do. It’s on me now––not as a student, not as a scribe, but as a first responder. I didn’t even know what a first responder was until COVID allowed news articles to put them in each and every headline last year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There are so many in-betweens ahead. I’ve been thinking about memory permanence––the fact that I vividly remember my lunch from today, but if you asked me about lunch a month ago, I would be pulling at straws. There’s a reason for this––it’s important for me to know what I had for lunch today and when, which will allow for a proper dinner and nutrition. But that scale only lasts around 24 hours––the question remains: what sticks?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Pain sticks. Love sticks. Hope sticks. Desire sticks. I couldn’t tell you what I had for lunch in 2015, but I can tell you who I wanted to be, who I wanted to love, and who I was so dreadfully furious at.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I don’t remember when, but we had an assignment when I was in middle school to write a letter to our future selves. These letters work best, of course, when we don’t remember what we wrote all those years ago. But in this and all analogous assignments, I vaguely remember what I said, what I thought I would need to hear five years down the line. Usually I wrote about needing to make 10 albums before I could enter into my Taylor Swift era. Perhaps a bit more forecasting and accurate predictions could have been weighed in the hands of my 10 year old self, but I don’t blame the past at all. (I also could not have predicted Taylor Swift’s future, let alone my own.)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The truth is we can’t predict what will stick. As a parent, you don’t know if your kid is even going to remember their terrible 4th birthday with a black eye, but I do. Ask me about birthdays 5 through 12? No idea.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What we remember and what we have done comprise our identity. Memories teach us lessons school never got around to, and we act accordingly. So am I only my 4th birthday, and not my 5th through 12th?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">No, because I have that 24 hour period. There are crushes I don’t remember, stuffed animals that I couldn’t tell you the name of. But it mattered then. I weighed it into my character during those moments, which is part of the reason that I am older, and most of the reason that I am not the same person that I was when I was younger. We shift––partially because of the new experiences around us, but also because of the old experiences that we end up keeping. All I can truly remember is right now.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So I will continue to walk this road named after a bird––partially out of necessity, but mostly out of bittersweet nostalgia for something that I will never remember with as much clarity as I once did.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Until next,</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Alex</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We are living in the temporary. I am living with people who do not imagine this as an essential part of their life. Their work is the subtext, and I’m too far in the details to be seen in this montage scene.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I have yet to keep a plant alive longer than a few weeks. I remember to water it for the first few days. Still, as I realize that the rest of my life remains largely the same, I know that I do not have the time or the emotional energy to care for a living thing, be it a significant other or a monstera. There is nothing quite as embarrassing as watching your two-week-old plant die on the windowsill.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We are not meant to be immortal. We would be far worse people if we were.&nbsp;And such as we shouldn’t be immortal, the only worse sin would be to be immobile––unmoving and unchanging, teasing the fleeting time.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’ll be leaving Honor Bar soon. I never thought a job would feel like an odd family. I’m not close to everyone there, but I hope to maintain many friendships with people remaining in Dallas.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Does our awareness of time fleeting make it harder or easier? Does knowing things will pass make us wait until they do or dread the day they do? I usually try to lean on the optimistic side, but dread is far easier than patiently waiting. I dread the time passing because I dread change. I&nbsp; trust myself to adapt to such change, but it means more decisions, agency, and responsibility to do the right thing with my life. Am I doing that now?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I am “under,” as we say in the service industry, in many areas of my life.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Chess has taken up many hours of my life. I have been playing every night when I get home from work and first thing in the morning. I’m no good—indeed, if I were good at the game, I would most definitely brag about it—but I think I keep playing because every single game is different. Unlike other games I’ve played, there is something below the surface with chess. I can tell when I’m playing against a person or a computer. I can tell what moves are fundamentals of the game or a personalistic choice. I can look a little ahead into the future, giving me a pseudo-sense of time travel. If a game can give me that, I’ll play as much of it as I can.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I have always been pretty aware of the fact that people come in and out of my life. It has been, however, far more evident recently than in the past. From Exeter, I keep in touch with those close or even tangent to; there was a shared drive towards creativity. But from Honor Bar, each server and staff member is on their path in a wide variety of directions, ranging widely in age and chances of success.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I am trying not to panic. That usually doesn’t develop quite well, as trying not to panic leads to panic when I fail. My finals are coming up, I had my last day of work, and the future looks quite murky. I am afraid to fully commit because it means defending an end that I am not sure I am prepared or cut out for.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I am not sure why I fear becoming an adult; I am constantly yearning for the future while feeling nostalgic for my past. It’s not that I’m not able to live in the present, but I don’t see the same appeal in the now as I do in the was and will be. It doesn’t become storytelling until it’s a part of the timeline or a prediction later on in the plot. The grass is greener on the other side until it seems that when you finally arrive, it’s not quite the green you hoped it would be.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It is all, whether we like it or not, in our control. Sometimes it is easier to suspend it—to believe that you have left it up to the Universe’s weavers to decide—but you are the one who feels regret. Who feels doubtful. Who could or would have said just one more word if only you believed it was in your hands. I have wavered on this topic; control, a manageable amount, eases much of my anxiety, but an overwhelming amount feels like machinery, and a lack of it entirely leaves me aimless and without fear of the future. That fear is what waters the grass, by the way.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I went to the Texas Fair Park Butterfly Gardens with a good friend of mine, and the actual site was beautiful. I don’t think much about insects anymore, which comes hand in hand with tempting agoraphobia, but seeing them without the world's business was quite a spectacle. They are magnificent creatures: polymorphic and masters of mimicry, capable of traveling greater distances than I have seen, and aposematism. Aposematism is the mastery of advertising fraud—to ward off enemies by making them believe you are poisonous. I feel proficient in mimicry, but only because I leave myself open, leaving no illusion of danger. That’s not to say I have any need for aposematism, but sometimes I wish I could ward everyone off with just a glance, without any need for explanation. (Which, in retrospect, feels more aligned with the insect’s ability to camouflage.)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">While we were in the main butterfly greenhouse, an older man sat in a chair near the entrance with a volunteer nametag. He said nothing as we entered the conservatory, but as we slowly made our way to the end, he chirped up.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Did you see the quail?” A few moments of looking at the ground instead of the trees below us followed his question.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Sure enough, there was a quail quite happy at the bottom of the bush, making eye contact with him. My friend and I proceeded to laugh and wave at the bird, who lacks all ability to understand what a wave, let alone a greeting, could mean from a human. It stayed put with its head perched.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The man, whose name I would kill to remember, showed us some aspects of the butterfly house we had missed and demonstrated his vast knowledge of the site after ten years of volunteering there. After our few minutes of conversation had died down, he whistled.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Wihh… zel!” We both made eye contact with him in wonder.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Wihh...zel!” The bird was not late to reply.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Wihh...zel!” The man chuckled to himself, but we stayed focused. A one-time reply can happen by all means of coincidence. So we witness many trials to ensure the precision of our data.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Wihh...zel!” With the loveliest sudden sentence, the bird called back, replying back and forth ten times in succession.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There is not much more to say about the man and this quail. I’m sure they continued talking far after we headed out the sliding doors. I wonder how many birds he has spoken to over his ten years and how many times they reply in a way he can understand. How many times he has worried about them calling back.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You may call it mimicry, but I see no reason to believe that this man would mimic for ten years. I worry about being different people in different parts of my life—one of the places that I felt that the most was at Honor Bar. I felt like I was making calls, not because I trusted what they meant or believed they worked, but because I adapted to the people around me. So I am left with the question: is it mimicry if you pretend full-time? Is it mimicry if you act transparently? If you start to believe the illusion?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The future, as usual, is terrifying. But I hope I can find the call of a quail, to remind me just how much we are pretending.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Until next,</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Alex</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I am more worried about college now than I was last year because I’ve been out of an immersive academic environment for a year. I sometimes mistake that as a weakness, but the whole point of this year was to lean out of the burnout stage of my life; to do what I want to do because I have a curious drive to do so, rather than some other numerical or quantitative motive.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There are only a few months left until I’m in the belly of the beast––that time will pass far faster than I think it will.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A few of my friends, not just coworkers, are quickly fading out of my life due to new chapters. After seeing so many come and go, I don’t expect to keep in touch; instead, I hope that if we one day end up in the same 20-mile radius, I might go out of my way to reconnect.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I feel tremendous guilt when I rest, and as I do all things, when I do rest, I rest in excess. This habit isn’t necessarily a bad thing when I don’t have too much on my plate, but it also means that I withdraw myself from the statement “if only I had the time.” The time will always come; the more significant question becomes how to use and prioritize this time. I’m not sure if it’s due to laziness or a lack of inspiration, but I’ve been moving quite slowly on all of my projects.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I am tired of analyzing the uncertain. It feels repetitive, Sysiphian, and somehow, that is not enough reason for me to stop. I know there is a strong likelihood that I might learn something along the way, but there must be a better way to be a person by learning through mindset and principles rather than hoping you make mistakes that teach you lessons you didn’t know you were supposed to learn. Suppose instead I believe or abide by a declaration of curiosity and exploration. In that case, I am left with the same cycle of analyzing what feels most pressing--the uncertain, predictably back in the very place it began. That is what makes it so intriguing to me--it is genuinely unavoidable.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So what is inevitable? You could go back to Descartes, who would reply that the only certain thing is whomever, or rather, whatever can doubt its existence. Maybe I’m addicted to proving that I am certain.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">But the “I” is notably not included in interpretations of Descartes’ certainty clause. The thinking thing is certain, but whether you (the person you would scowl at in a true mirror) are the one in control of that thinking thing; whether you are a figment of imagination deceiving the thinking thing is uncertain.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So then I leave my good faith invested in my thinking thing. It’s not necessarily my brain, and calling it a spirit would be a stretch, but somehow, I can control it or perceive it. Perceiving it is a far scarier idea--that would mean that even the process of doubting can be deceiving to “I”...</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">For the sake of reasonable certainty, I usually hope that I am in control of my thinking thing. But sometimes I lose it: when I’m stressed about something retroactively mediocre, when I lose something I didn’t even think I had, and when I leave doors without tapping the other side twice. Rituals and spirals, in my experience, go hand in hand. There is nothing scarier than watching yourself perform a script out of pure skepticism.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So when I am faced with uncertainty, which often leads to anxiety, I rely on my thinking thing. But my thinking thing is also not entirely playing by my rules--sometimes it wanders, repeats, and scrutinizes the intonation of a text.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It’s not a civil war, and overall I think our relationship works. But it always comes back: the fact that the mechanism that I rely on for certainty is certain, but in a way that I cannot control, leaves me feeling agentless, primitive, passive, and prey. Prey of some machine far above me, and at this point, we’ve taken the train back to existentialism.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Most traditional western metaphysical philosophy ended after Kant (he must have had a few pretty important things to say), and we’ve abandoned most of the big questions over a few thousand years. Kant leaves us behind, telling us that we shouldn’t worry about what is above or beyond us since we cannot perceive that world with clarity.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">But an essential pillar of Descartes is that you can only be sure that the thinking thing exists when you are in the process of doubting your existence. Ironically, I feel the least is certain when the present doesn’t feel real enough, especially when all I can seem to focus on is certainty.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And even if, by some miracle, the thinking thing (while doubting) is the only certain thing, I don’t think it means that it’s the only thing that matters. There is much importance in the uncertain—regardless of daunting it may seem. Out of control and reckless prophecies lie in the skeptical. I control it to a certain extent, but there’s a veil of ignorance to make the game fair and make sure that I'm not too self-aware.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As I face the future, I hope to evaluate uncertain questions rather than evaluate what is and isn’t certain. I hope to take a page from Kant and instead of asking “why?” I hope to ask, “so what?”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I don’t think there is any solution to fear. The natural way to alleviate it is to comfort the worry: somehow prove that there is no rational reason for fear, but I’m tired of coming up with logical explanations for irrational emotions. This question remains at the top of my mind, and the short story that I have been working on this year (a long short story) aims to confront that question.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">How is the very thing we are afraid of, which tends to be death, is resistant to any more rationalization about itself? The characters are being chased by something that appears to be life-threatening, and even as they learn more and more about it, they don’t feel any more relieved. Death itself could wave its hands and explain that it’s here, but the fear of death remains prominent regardless. That is the duality of rationalization and emotion––we believe that describing feeling will subside it, but despite rationalization, emotion pursues since it is inherently irrational. We explain that we are sad because the world seems to be ending, but the causation doesn’t imply a cure. So in the meantime, we come up with smaller and smaller fragments of meaning, which aim to distract us.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I can’t decide if it’s better to be distracted or to confront the truth. I don’t know if that’s my decision. In the meantime, I will let it happen around me.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I have a very odd songwriting process. About once every three days, I’ll get a melody or song lyrics running through my head, after which I will promptly record an improvised song based on the “seed.” Sometimes the improv will be awful, and I commit to dropping the idea entirely; sometimes it’s what I imagined, and I only have to change a few words; but most often, it is a stanza or two of work that I am proud of, and the rest is repetitive jumble (as improv is expected to be when done repetitively). I learned this technique through summers in creative writing programs. I had one teacher who told us to write a six-page paper on a topic, and they asked us to scrap everything except the last sentence and start from there.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It’s much easier for me to make a first draft than for me to make revisions. Revisions imply that something has been somewhat polished, and it’s hard for me to accept when something is ready or if it should be scrapped entirely. It goes back to the idea that it doesn’t feel like a failure if you never try your hardest. The problem with that strategy is that I have no idea what my best is, and I'm not sure how to force myself to get there.&nbsp;<br></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In summary: certainty doesn’t alleviate anxiety, and there isn’t much that does in a long-term manner besides resolution. I’m on the edge of a cliff right now, and I’m hesitating to jump out of fear, but that fear may permeate over years and years--so why not jump now? And how do I materialize that jump to make sure that it means more than a first draft?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Much is uncertain, and much is to be feared. I don’t expect that to change anytime soon.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Until next,</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Alex</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br><br></p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I am currently in Boston on a soul-searching expedition. I don’t know what I’m expecting to find or where exactly I am looking for it. I have plenty of mixed feelings about flying. On the one hand, I am awed by the sheer amount of people going back and forth––to and from “home.” But, on the other hand, I’ve been watching married couples argue over how to make their baby stop crying, people in business who have far too many tabs open for one laptop to run efficiently, and people that almost look like someone I know. But not quite.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I love the feeling of walking along the sidewalk, and everyone else thinking that I’m living a far more exciting life than I am––emulating the life of a writer who is somehow paid a yearly salary, a professor who just got off for summer break, an archaeologist whose dig was canceled. The scariest part of that thought is that I don’t know which image I’m trying to portray. I feel the urge to impress other people––presumably because I assume everyone in the world is somehow in some dystopian optimistic present, when realistically, they are faking it exactly as I am.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I like the idea that I can pack a suitcase and go anywhere in the world, but I do that very infrequently. Why? Well, curiosity and growth are good in theory, but they’re much murkier in practice.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I talked to an old friend of mine in Cambridge last night, and she told me this story. She babysits on the side, and the kid asked, “What is lightning?” The friend mentioned above is a chemistry major at Harvard, mind you, and they had a vague idea, but not an answer satisfying enough to a child. I thought about the question a bit––it’s some combination of electrons from clouds to the ground. When answering said friend, they replied, “Why would I need to know that? And yeah, I can Google it, but I won’t remember the answer after a minute. It’s not relevant enough in my life.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I resonated with my friend’s statement, mainly because I’ve been evaluating the virtue of curiosity. I believe it’s essential to keep asking questions, but I also tend to ask a million worlds away. Kant’s phenomenal and noumenal seem to blend. So the question becomes: is it better to continue searching for what feels unknowable, or to focus on what we can reasonably prove?</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I have received my housing assignment for the coming year, and I have what seems like a million advising meetings coming up. I learned a bit from my trip––exactly what, yet? I’m unsure. But I loved the feeling of being watched while entirely alone. I wasn’t paranoid that my OCD was impacting anyone besides myself; I could explore at my own pace and be in exactly as many social situations as I desired. And as I enter college, I don’t know that I’ll be able to do it at my own pace, honestly––the decision-making process seems to starts immediately.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I usually panic on a binary scale, which means that most decisions that rely on such a system are my Achilles’ heel. I have relied on being a “jack-of-all-trades” as an excuse for not genuinely excelling at anything. I am passionate about so much that I used it as an excuse to avoid deliberate concentration or improvement. Now that the funnel is continuing, I feel immense pressure to pick one or find a unique way to combine them all. The problem with interdisciplinary work is that there are pretty limited career options to implement all of your degrees. I’m told by hairstylists and Uber drivers that I can always keep some passions as a hobby and continue cultivating them on my own time. Still, I think the problem is that now that I am old enough and in an academic environment to do all of them, I feel motivated to do so. Is completing a double major with a minor impossible? No. But are there unforeseen sacrifices that I would have to make to achieve such a degree? Absolutely. And that is the uncertainty that makes me doubt doing it all.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I want to be integrated without being isolated. In recognition that I feel regretful of some of my prep and lower years at Exeter, I am hoping that I lean into productive mistakes more often.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Course selection enforces a lot of this anxiety. I essentially need to plan when in my time at Duke I can “handle” the most, and that is a balancing act that I haven’t even seen the beginning of yet.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I have started rock climbing, which is something that I could never have envisioned for this year. My body feels tired, but my mind feels like it’s running at a million miles a minute. To be clear––I am an absolute beginner at bouldering, usually only going through V1-V4 routes. I like the feeling of looking at the wall and planning your route, executing on it, and improving for the next run. My climbing partner commented today that I often get halfway up a path, which is usually the most challenging part, then drop down to the mat. I’m not sure if that’s simply because of my limited stamina or strength or if I’m the type of athlete who wants to feel confident in the next move. When I ran, I stopped when it started hurting. I’ve never experienced any runner’s high––I usually feel cramped up and drained afterward. But with climbing, I can pace myself while still feeling plenty sore later. Sure, it’s not cardio, but at least I’m spending more than a few minutes using my body every day.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’m finding myself embarrassed of the things I say more often. Part of that is meeting new people and talking from the edge; other times, it’s saying things that are hyperbole as a means to be relatable or to not ramble. I don’t trust what I said yesterday, let alone the day before. Half of that is me overthinking my past interactions; most of it is attempting to seem approachable. I often find my statements limited in empathy—assumptions that I make about my experience are usually limited to mine alone. It makes me worry that my generalizations about the world probably tend to be selfish.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I can’t tell how often I lie to myself. Of course, some lies feel larger than others, some feel more like excuses. But, most feel like lies now that I pause and think about it.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In the <em>Midnight Library</em> by Matt Haig, the main character is essentially faced with the Library of Babel filled with her regrets. The problem is that she has already died; regrets upon death seem far more daunting than when alive. The regrets that I have currently have don’t feel pressing enough or don’t feel like they have a good enough trade-off. But I’m trying to live my life as if I am looking at my own Book of Regrets: I should spend less time on social media, I wish my life were more fulfilling, I regret not balancing my life enough.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So here is to living life, not without regrets, but instead readily aware of them.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Best,</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Alex</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Sometimes I dream of being able to spin a cocoon for myself—not with any man-made tool, but to have been born with a safe haven. I have had a busy few weeks: performing shows with artists in Dallas, finalizing my Duke courses and language placement, a trip to LA, and the capstone will be the songwriting and ancient civilization courses that I am teaching these next few weeks.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I have a lot of faith in strangers. I want to be clear in my distinction of trust as opposed to faith—trust is nurtured, faith is berated until there is none. I would like to have faith that most people are good people, in re: “Strangers.” Innocent until proven guilty.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">My anxiety is the largest barrier to my faith, but it is also the largest agent propelling it forward. I am not meant to be around other people. I have come close to perfecting the art of a one-on-one interaction; I’m able to both send and receive cues to make sure that each person is on the same page, and such I feel confident in my ability to socialize. The instant that one-on-one becomes a group of people, I lose my footing—I usually talk more to myself than other people in those instances.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Teaching these classes reminds me why I feel an urge to teach. I feel the same way about the relationship I have with my tutoring students––it’s not about just teaching the right thing, but teaching the right way to approach failure and not understanding. There isn’t much better than being able to relieve someone of confusion. That feeling is more clear in subjects like Latin and Greek where that’s a method to madness, but there’s also a hope in literature analysis of trying to decipher the author’s idea; trying to decipher each other.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I have loved performing these past few weeks. I love the feeling of stepping on a pile of gaff tape, talking to the audience in a more honest rapport than I keep with myself, and playing into the character of the song narrator. I usually go home a bit disappointed, which starts the frenzy of writing an revising all over again. There is an odd instance or two where I feel defeated and dismiss all notions of music for a week or two, but I have some calling towards it. Hell is without a guitar and a notebook.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’ve always been keen to record much of my life––a concept which I’m pretty sure I’ve touched on before. But it used to be the relationships I wanted to remember, the group pictures, the odd doodle on scratch paper. Now, I want to remember the perspective. When I feel nostalgia, I don’t think of 5th grade relationships; instead, I remember feeling like the small underdog, battling obstacle after obstacle to finally become a success story. Now I don’t even know what would constitute success. I do feel a bit larger than I did.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I took a trip to Los Angeles to visit a good friend, and the scariest thing to me about the trip were how many adults we met––which led me to bring a mirror to myself. Not too far off from adult after all. Which, did I mention, is the scariest thing anyone could ever tell me? In all sincerity, the world feels so much larger when it is unfamiliar. There was something comforting about adventure; that drive makes me reluctant to sit at home even post travel.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I am ready to give my all this fall. I want to force honesty upon myself, and the only true way to do that is to face failure as often as possible with it all on the line. I’m starting to make decisions about my four-year plan (which, by the way, I am more than flexible to change. Even when I don’t know what I’m doing with my life, you should believe that I even have the uncertain planned out). I’m not going to decide the person I want to become in college because I know it doesn’t work that way. But I want to be in communities I feel comfortable with and some that I feel like more than a beginner.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I worry that I’ve forgotten how to stop performing. It sounds cliche that I’m admitting it all feels like an act––I think the person that I am around myself is someone no one else has met. I don’t think there’s any inherent shame that I have towards this person, but I think the narrative is different than I portray it. It’s constantly seeking––if I let it lose, I’d lose my agency.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">But if I were to try and describe this person, he would be stern, cynical, and obsessive; trading hopes of the future with fears from the past. I don’t truly believe I can ever fix a mistake, and I think that follows me whether I get away or not. It’s been a pretty constant dialogue recently: reminders of who I think I should be.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’m hesitant to let that person out because I think he’s far more destructive than I am. I’m not interested in that type of manslaughter: I’m more patient. Mostly because I don’t feel the same type of ambition––I feel ambition as a catalyst, he sees it as survival.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I have just returned from a quick trip that I took to Austin to see a good friend. The trip was quite fun, ranging from boat and golf cart rides to odd family reunions. While immersed in that situation, I felt quite insecure about how I was able to flow with others. I felt off cadence, off topic, off step, which in turn led to further insecurity. I am much better when talking to eight people as opposed to one. That phenomena, I believe, is tied to the performance of it all. In a group of eight, I can tell what my place is, where my comedic timing should be, and what I should be driving in the conversation. The doors feel open, inviting, and almost playful––I can play bits with some in the conversation while peaking the interests of others.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I should add that all of this self evaluation is starting to make me fear being manipulative. I should also state that I don’t feel like a “fake” person––what I’m saying is genuine, but the scale is far different. The perspective is auto-corrected.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I watched a lot of people this month, all from private concerts to Y2K parties. I am realizing more often that there really isn’t one way to win it. Which, of course, would be awful, but at least it would be simple. Maybe it’s the obstacle of it not being simple that the true course leads us up to.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Where next? Duke, in less than a month. To Small Town Records, to Hoof N’ Horn, to Giles, to Freedom and Moral Obligation––all vernacular that I hope will become well integrated into my lexicon. I’ve thought about keeping this blog as a time capsule of this year, but I have liked the way it’s made me think.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I want to keep this blog because I’ve loved watching myself growing up. I’ve mentioned this befreo, but in the form of notebooks, of songs, of pictures, of finstas. But I the hope is that this record keeping might amount to something. The risk of making that tethered to the world feels real––it’s a record of my evolution for each to judge, though few actually stumble upon it. It feels intimate. It feels like you’re somehow supposed to be reading this.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And in a shocking turn of events, the accountability results. I like that process––being vulnerable enough to the people who are even remotely interested. The idea that even a few people are interested in watching a process that they are a part of, and a process that they are quite familiar with: asking why.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So, with that being said, here’s a cheers to you: to the people who, for some reason, found themselves clicking a link from an email or an instagram story, who are ready to watch themselves grow.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Here’s to another year of public record keeping; another year of trying to find the best balance of life.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Best,</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Alex</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Before I get into the nitty-gritty of this month, I'd like to point out a mistake that I made last month. A friend of mine read over the July post and noticed that I directly contradicted myself.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>I have come close to perfecting the art of a </em><strong><em>one-on-one</em></strong><em> interaction; I'm able to both send and receive cues to make sure that each person is on the same page, and as such, I feel confident in my ability to socialize. However, the instant that one-on-one becomes a group of people, I lose my footing—I usually talk more to myself than other people in those instances.</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>In a </em><strong><em>group of eight</em></strong><em>, I can tell what my place is, where my comedic timing should be, and what I should be driving in the conversation. The doors feel open, inviting, and almost playful––I can play bits with some in the conversation while peaking the interests of others.&nbsp;</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I should also add to this juxtaposition that there isn't much scarier in the world than someone saying, "oh, I read your blog post." Part of it is the disparity between my perception and performance, but I've tied most fears to failure and her cousins, of which there are many.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I don't think this was just a mistake on the page, and in a short period of retrospect, the words "perfecting" and "one-on-one interaction" are a unique and boisterous pair. I have to work in hyperbole, or else this would be mundane note-taking. To sum it up, I don’t think I’ve come close to understanding either.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I have now been at Duke for a week, and I, as many others are, am quite overwhelmed––not only by the number of opportunities I already feel like I'm missing out on, but the social element can drown you. There are the typical college shenanigans of frat parties and "darties," which is a new word for me. Still, I think the most prevalent social catalyst is the frenzy for a group of people to text about lunch. I don't know if I've found my people yet––it's hard to judge that before I'm able to reflect on all of this with a bit of separation. I feel like a part of the rat race right now.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">My classes start today, ranging from Chemistry to Philosophy, and I don't feel prepared, but I sure as hell will look it. Without that, the illusion falls. Duke is notoriously work hard, play hard, but I think a more accurate description is "work hard, tell no one." The students who claim they didn't even study might have spent around two hours reviewing––everyone is like each other, meaning that all of our bullshit is falling through.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I am at an inherent disadvantage because my interests are diverse. I can explore, but I also lose the confidence to commit to the business society or the symphony auditions. I saw it on the calendar and looked the other way. Is that because I don't want to be involved in the classical music scene on campus, or was I just too lazy to be proactive about my interests?&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I worry that I am not the "go-getter" that I so proudly was in high school. Still, I&nbsp; don't feel any urgency to be that person yet—shockingly. I've started to believe the advice that freshman year should be about exploration and balance, not everything all at once. Maybe I burned out of everything all at once.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I'm not expecting to find my footing, but let me be clear. There is a distinction: knowing something will be uncertain does not make it certain, as I've established in previous months. I don't know who I want to be yet, which most would reply with "yourself," which brings me back to the rabbit hole of last month and pretending. I can't even find a new question to obsess over when my answers are references to previous unanswerables.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What other unanswerables await? How can I make sure that this chemistry class doesn't make or break me? It's Chem 101, which countless other first-year students from all around the world have completed, but my takeaways and commitment to the course will change my path at Duke. Taking it and enjoying it (sort of?) would mean opening the door to inorganic and organic, leading to medical school; taking it and wanting it to be over would lead to the neuroscience major; taking it and hating the essence of the study would mean abandoning STEM entirely. There will always be someone better.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It's now far later in the month, and I have a few more things to comment on. I have been accepted into the Pitchforks, Duke's oldest all-male a cappella group-–I immediately felt relief. They welcomed me into what already feels like a make-shift family, and I don't think I realized how much I missed making music with others. (It also doesn't hurt that I'm joined by two of my PEADs alumni).</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I have already alleviated most of my fears about performance; it's clear that I'm still the tryhard that I always have been. I am overwhelmed by the pure optionality that I have access to––I don't think I fully grasped how large 15,000 is. As I've mentioned in this series before, humans are notoriously bad at predicting the future and seeing out of our perspective. That sure won't stop us from trying.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">All of my classes have been better than I expected: exploring topics from Plato's Republic and social contract, looking at how economic principles fail when assessing our market from a sociology perspective, translating dear <em>inventus</em> Catullus, maddened by passion, and learning about enthalpy and calorimetry. Classes range in size, but I have only felt anticipation before each one.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">One prediction that seems to have come true is my tendency to try and prove myself to others. Of course, Imposter syndrome doesn't leave with willpower, but it certainly shouldn't be a focus for me.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I've started taking subjects more seriously––to be clear, this could be freshman ambition, but I've been intentionally translating much slower and reviewing concepts before and after chemistry lectures. I've realized that I don't hate school, as I claimed to when I was much younger. I hate feeling frustrated, and that feeling only arrives when there's dissonance between what I could be doing and what I'm doing. I feel in control again. I think direction is pulling me left and right.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I am trying to embrace being the fool on campus, and I've succeeded in making a fool of myself. Such examples include walking into the wrong classroom and calling Nicola Ultra "MK Ultra." That one is endlessly embarrassing because it showcases not only my lack of social fluency but also an odd amount of knowledge of a CIA torture study, possibly displaying… masochism?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Stress has hit close to home. But it has also reminded me that I am a force with which to be reckoned. Even when I stumble over my words in a class discussion, I know that I will start the reading for the class next week on the bus ride following.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As far as who I would like to be, I think it would be presumptuous to try and decide that. Right now, I want to find equilibrium and revel in the routine that I have been craving for so long.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">With that being said, here is to new beginnings and another year of pause.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Best,</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Alex</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">September has been a whirlwind of a month, but hopefully, I can bring myself to summarize and reflect on the majority of happenings—at least the ones that seem most potent.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In the past few weeks, I’ve: auditioned for American Idol, experienced a wide variety of college social activities, started art history research on Duke’s image database of Medieval Sicily, had dinner with a neuroscience professor, been to a Duke football game, struggled through a few chemistry labs and did decently on the midterm (alleviating August’s worry), sang more than I have far too long, learned Telemann’s Sonata in A Minor for oboe, took a trip to Camden, SC with Pitchforks (a cappella), and been hired as an audio engineer for Small Town Records (Duke’s record label). To be brief, I’ve been working hard on projects and with people that I care about—I couldn’t be happier.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There are moments that I try to take a step back and smell the roses, but just like at Exeter, time moves differently here; a week feels like a month. So while I want to lean back and enjoy fall break, which starts in approximately three hours, I can’t stop focusing on the two papers and the take-home exam looming on the other side. I’ve realized that being ahead of my work makes little difference in how I see the job—it still seems overbearing.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The biggest challenge I’ve faced so far is intrapersonal meddling with the interpersonal. I seem to get in my head—I always have and always will—but that doesn’t feel like a satisfying resolution. I think many of my overthinking tendencies will slow down as I continue to get more comfortable with my people here. I’m still hesitant to call them my people, not because of anything they have done proactively, but I have difficulty understanding if I’m myself around them. I’ve written about self-deceit before on this blog, but again, it’s hard to be reflective when I’m living it.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I find myself giving lots of advice to many who have a more challenging time adjusting to college than I am. That’s not to say that everything has been peachy, but I’m assuredly getting closer to a comfortable equilibrium. I would probably be happier if I took a bit more of my advice, only to give back what others have given to you, to take things at face value, to lean into being the fool. It’s much easier to tell others what to do. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I need to decide on classes soon, which means I also need to determine more direction in my academic path. I’m trying not to panic; I’m trying to believe that I have time to decide. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I have loved my classes. We’re finishing up Catullus and starting Tibullus in Latin, and the discussions about the Roman ideal of masculinity have permeated my daily life analysis. I’m writing about self-interested morality for my Freedom and Obligation class and a counterargument to Robert Nozick’s Anarchy, State, and Utopia for my Freedom of the market class. Chemistry lulls in the background—that’s not to say that I’m not captivated by the concepts, but the class size makes it feel quite dystopian. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’ll keep it brief this month—I think much of the reflection for this month will come after. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">With the best of luck,</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Alex</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A brief summary to start us off, as it usually goes:</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I should begin with the fall break that I was feeling so anxious about at the time of my last post. I was on an uphill climb at that point; I had two essays and a critical analysis ahead of me. I've started to notice that benchmarks like that tend to define the period that I'm in and the space that surrounds the milestone. I'm trying to separate myself from that mentality by spreading assessments into smaller assignments, but that is proving harder in practice than theory.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Fall break itself was quite an enjoyable experience: I was able to bond with many of the members of Pitchforks without the context of Duke looming over our shoulders. I didn't feel rushed for the first time this academic year, and that's a feeling that I'm trying to incorporate more into my routine (of course, the nature of relaxation or ease being scheduled into a routine seems a bit too oxymoronic). I look up to a lot of the group's older members: how they model a balance, how they prioritize, and how they all are honest in their interpersonal interactions. I missed being around people who see larger than college, an attribute that I have not seen prominently displayed since characters from my gap year. They know who they are—this is water.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I learned more traditional beach activities, such as the infamous game of Spikeball. Still, I also watched friends play melodica at the beach during the sunset, heard stories from home while swinging on a hammock, and brushed up on my Catan skills. While I can't say that I'm entirely comfortable to "be myself" (only due to semantics and the issue of defining such terms), I can say that I feel like Pitchforks is my backbone; a backbone for which I lean on often and am quite grateful for. We donned our velvet blazers, and I cannot express the relief I felt when it fit, despite being outside the size offerings.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I read two books this month: <em>Kafka on the Shore</em> by Haruki Murakami and <em>Cat's Cradle</em> by Kurt Vonnegut. Both offered refreshing literary images that I hadn't seen in English in quite a long time. Somehow the myth of a runaway is a story that fell into rhythm with my few weeks with it; I missed the feeling of wanting to feel like the character you're reading about.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I should mention that I have continued to take oboe lessons this semester, which has been a mixed bag of emotions for me. I have always had a complicated relationship with the instrument, as it brings out my inner perfectionist and critic. I'm learning Telemann's Sonata in A Minor, and while the piece is not complex by traditional means, it has been my first real piece of repertoire since March 2020. Oboe wasn't something that I felt motivated to keep up within the midst of the pandemic, but it's something that I found myself missing after I left it behind.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">My instructor, who has been nothing but supportive as I relearn scales, has noticed trends that quickly lead to psychoanalysis: stopping a phrase because of a small mistake, having many false starts, moving the stand closer each time I make a mistake (implying that it's a matter of vision as opposed to skill). These tiny ticks signal more immense insecurity in my playing, which leads to frustration, which certainly does not have positive physiological impacts on the dynamic breathing needed for such an instrument. It's a good metric of my perfectionism: if I push myself too far, it makes the act of playing impossible. If, for example, I were to turn in a chemistry lab an hour late due to a break in routine, that doesn't mean I should start drafting an email to explain my actions and drive myself into an emotional spiral over 0.3% of my grade. Still, instead, I should do what I can to turn in the lab incorrectly. All hypothetical, of course.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Another high-stress activity was my Small Towns Records audition. It's not that I genuinely expected to be signed, but the pressure of performing for a live audience for the first time in months was quite nerve-wracking. Small Town Records is Duke's record label, which seems far more like a fever dream than anything. Nevertheless, I brought out some old songs, sang for friends and strangers, and I'm still heavily involved in STR as an audio engineer. So I have much to look forward to in that regard––there's a sense of urgency that has been driving me to an odd request. STR also led me to Duke's Coffeehouse, which has brought me to corroborate work with comfort in a way that I've had a difficult time doing here so far.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Working as an audio engineer feels like you're living in a nightmare that you're flying a plane without a pilot's license. While we're still in a highly shadow-based role, I realized that while I have taught myself the technical skills, I never needed to communicate them to other people. There's going to be a learning curve, but one that I am eager to fall down. I've become more comfortable asking questions––I'm only going to get out what I put in.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Part of that process, however, opened me back up to musical collaboration. October held, quite tenderly, a few of the most incredible memories I have yet of creating with others. I think the phenomenon of music as a language has been especially shocking for me since I speak it differently than they do. At first, that was discouraging––now it's enticing.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">My research for the Kingdom of Sicily project also allows me to enter an odd headspace. I feel like I'm looking for something that so few have looked for; whether or not it is "worth" looking for is a far more complicated feeling to cope with. There have been a few exciting discoveries: churches that started as Roman temples, Greek graffiti that I could transliterate and translate, but the far more exciting mysteries are the ones that haven't been solved or those I have yet to understand.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I have a terrible habit of babysitting, especially when I feel like I owe something to other people. Somehow, it must be that helping others out (even, mistakably, when they can take care of themselves) proves something about me. That's not to say that my motivation for it feels selfish, but I do know that it must be that way. I care that those around me feel comfortable for unmentioned reasons (praeterritio), which drives me to hyper-supplement support, in effect belittling them. Again, that's not to say that babysitting is a bad thing; it's just something I need to make sure that I'm not projecting onto other people. I feel proud of moments of notable caretaking, but I still find myself doubting how exactly I'm helping others. I don't trust my intentions, to be blunt.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I think the flaw in caring for others is that I often do it with the image of my (short-term) sacrifice: leaving a room to clean a mess up, using my time as opposed to making others dedicate theirs, etc. I understand that these are "selfless," but it would be hard to affirm that it feels that way. Somehow I feel guilty when I'm not helping, but more of the lurking shadow of guilt when I'm the one to solve the problem.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It's almost like I'm playing into an archetype that I don't know if I can truly embody. As aforementioned, these acts often come at my own expense with little acknowledgment, leaving me with nothing to hold myself upon. I think that came to a peak as the dynamics between friends changed, as I learned that there is a difference between taking care of people and fixing them. (It would be more apt to say learning, but a blog beckons conclusion.)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Propertius has been on my mind this month, and Sulpicia trails not far behind. I haven't felt this joy for the Classics in quite a long time, and while I find myself often stuttering over my translations in the classroom, I'm trying not to let that discourage my analysis. I've started writing songs about poets again––a process that always feels rejuvenating. I've been in an Ancient Greek reading group with a few students who have some prior Greek experience and a professor in the department here, and I've decided that I am embarking on the course in the spring. I'm weary, primarily because of my experience struggling through Greek my junior year of high school, but I'm hopeful. More than promising, though, I am more eager than ever to dive into the literature. I've only tipped my pedes into the pond of elegy while both Greek and Latin lyric remain.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It was fun to see my family interact with my community here. I think they're reacting well to my routine here, but there are definitely things that I hope to work on. I think they know that as well. It's a matter of communication, but it is also who has ownership over that communication. I'm a driving force in this, but it was beautiful to see them be as goofy as I remember them in person. They saw the Pitchforks perform, but the real show was watching all parents interact after the concert. I think I could have written quite a few character studies about that night, ranging in the profession, geography, and life mentalities. I forget how heterogeneous impromptu conversations can be when not confined to campus; it reminded me of late nights at Wild Detective last year.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I learned, from Isaiah Berlin, different definitions of liberty; both positive and negative liberty seem to lead to despotism. I've read Rawls and a few other writers on the topic of free will, and I can't help but be brought back to J.P. Sartre's The Flies, a piece that echoes as I'm walking and a book that I am destined to read again before the year's close. Nevertheless, I will miss having this philosophy course within my repertoire, forcing me to slow down and feel comfortable with not understanding.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I did have one moment of bravery in particular. At a Pitchforks event when the reigning Tenor 1 member was not present, I felt charismatic enough to substitute myself in for the part, and there was something quite magical about the adrenaline that I don't think I'll be able to articulate. It was the kind of affirmation that you don't crave until it's been served to you on a silver platter with your name engraved. That's not to say it's something I aim to pursue, but it was lovely as an odd gift. As a result, I've found myself leaning into social situations, a trend that is likely to continue into this month.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As expected, I have lost a bit of my furor from the beginning of the semester, but I think I'm near equilibrium; the problem is the persistent pendulum from week to week, or, even more horrid, day to day, that leads to discomfort. The classic case of the uncontrollable.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">With that classic archetypal ending: until next time.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Best,</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Alex Pieroni</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I have been trying hard this month—I’ve concluded that the cliche “dark and gloomy” winter is justified in its redundant definition. In literature, the seasonal symbolism of winter usually refers to death, old age, loneliness, an ending, or grief. Winter can be tranquil (see <em>Stopping by Woods On A Snowy Evening</em>, Frost), but the cold is peaceful even in Frost’s poem because it matches the narrator’s primary emotion. Winter drives tranquility only when it fits the setting—an excellent justification for feeling sad in winter (either before winter began or as a result of it).&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I read the beginning of <em>The Crossing</em> by Cormac McCarthy so that you can blame my run-on sentences on him. It was a book that I loved and was ambitious to read initially, but after around 100 pages, it lost its zeal. I feel guilty for not finishing it, mainly because I didn’t read anything else this month. So perhaps it's worth a revisit, or I think I’m supposed to believe it’s worth a revisit.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This brings us to the central argument that I’ve been obsessed with this month. Bear with me as I spit some jargon out for the sake of the piece. In my philosophy class, we read “Freedom of the Will and the Concept of Reason” by H. Frankfurt. Frankfurt distinguishes between first and second-order desires to separate person and animal. First-order desires are in the form of “A wants to do X,” with A being the agent and X being the action, and second-order desires are in the form of “A wants to do X,” with A being the agent and X referring to a first-order desire. He defines a person as one with second-order desires, while the animal only has first-order desires.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I was sold on the argument at this point, as it seems like a relatively reliable distinction from the compatibilist standpoint. There are things we want to do, but they’re also things that we don’t think about wanting to do: the impulse to eat isn’t a choice I make, but rather the nature of being a surviving thing. The extent of a first-order desire can be debated, but I’ll limit them to physiological desires. While you want to eat out of a first-order desire, there are times you want to want to eat or times that you don’t want to want to eat. That is your second-order desire: you want to act upon the first-order desire.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There is one last distinction needed to implement this argument for my overall thesis of this month. While there are second-order desires, the more pressing definition is second-order volition: acting under the second-order desire. For example, a smoker who wants to smoke out of a physical impulse can be one of a few variations. The unwilling smoker doesn’t want to smoke, so he either smokes and is being controlled by first-order desires or doesn’t smoke and definitively has the choice. Essentially it’s the capacity to choose contrary to the first-order desire that defines freedom of volition.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The far more troubling example is the willing smoker. The willing smoker wants to smoke, meaning that if he smokes, he is acting in line with his second-order and first-order desires. If he doesn’t smoke, then he has a different volition altogether. So when does the willing addict have freedom of intention? When he wants to want to smoke. The trouble with this is the ambiguity between first and second-order desires. How does the willing addict know that he is willing as opposed to overwhelmed by a first-order desire? (I don’t have a clear answer to this question yet, but I hopefully will by the time a related essay is due later this week.)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In short, winter overwhelmed me with first-order desires: to sleep, to hide, to record. I have met plenty of people, but I am more intrigued by the people I have already met. My friend, we’ll call him Dawn, brought up the worry flowchart to me. Essentially one evaluates whether or not there is a problem. If the answer is no, there is no need to worry. This is an excellent outline of filtering executive functioning, and I often get stuck at that step. I don’t usually find myself asking myself the question that way. It’s usually something more along the lines of “is there something I should be worried about?”. Nevertheless, I have a first-order desire to worry—it would be an understatement to call it an impulse.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Regardless, if there is a problem, the following question is, “can I do something about it?” if there’s nothing within one’s power to do, no need to worry. I have qualms with this question—there are things that I worry about being able to worry about, relationships that I see from afar, and I want to act as some odd messenger man just at the chance of doing something about it. So I’m trying to record how I can do “something about it” without that examination manifesting in worry without substance. However, that becomes especially difficult when there is a lot of worry <em>oneris</em> (of burden, loosely). Someone said that I seem the person that would only hurt before they get hurt, and I am afraid to investigate that further—another time.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I found more space, spending time with friends throughout the day but also making intentional commitments to go to an odd dinner here and there. I am so impressed by the people around me constantly—I can’t tell if that emotion comes from goodwill or envy. Some people feel more separate, like someone I'm watching, and some I can't distinguish if I want to know out of necessity or curiosity. I want to improve my creative process and take lots of inspiration from others, but that new acknowledgment of knowledge (i.e., there is more to know than you know) feels more overwhelming than enthralling.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">My readings of Kant this month have led to examinations of truth-telling and secret-keeping, and I don’t think there is a space more conducive for this intrigue than college. There are always three versions of a story here, but no individual has the whole thing. There are times to lie out of self-preservation, to benefit a relationship, to relieve tension. I am reluctant to admit that I have always been somewhat of a fibber, but it does have an assumption of higher knowledge; most people lie to “protect” others from information, assuming that they are somehow stronger or able to tolerate it. I think I can handle it, but am I the juror of others’ rational abilities? Again, uncertain. Lots of open questions this month.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So how am I? Well, for someone observing the dark winter driving a first-order desire to be warm, a half-read book, a hyper analysis of an anxiety chart, and significant doubts in my relationship with others, I’m doing just cheeky. I have spent a lot of nights just questioning how I end up in the situations that I do—indeed, the problem is not that everyone around me keeps messing up. Responsibility is not binary, especially when someone is liable for trust. But I’m finding it harder and harder to be patient in my relationships. My friend, one whom I’ve become quite close with as of late, said that each person one meets is a “little creature” to be studied. Semantics aside, I think I agree with that sentiment: I become close with people not because they are necessarily the model Kantian moralists, but because I understand their actions and the motivations behind them. If the logical progression makes sense, it’s not about fixing them or shaming them for some personal flaw. It’s a character study.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’ve been evaluating many character studies this month, especially with people I have known practically my whole life. Seeing people grow over the years can be jarring—I’d be silly to dismiss that. On the other hand, I think it’s scary that someone could become uninterested in my character study or that I could write the conclusion of someone else’s. For as much as I analyze others, the only person I trust to analyze me is myself. Again, reliable source? Uncertain. I had a vivid moment while sleeping on a tile floor over Thanksgiving break after many long conversations. I felt such dissonance: between myself and the situation I found myself in, the stories juggled between ear and ear only to be forgotten altogether, and the communication that can’t be transmitted.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In short, it has been hard to both forgive and to be forgiven this month. I’m not sure if I have an <em>onus</em> to apologize for, but I can certainly say that someone can disapprove of you and be proud of you. Someone can be friends or family with you without enjoying you. And that is the scariest part of winter—the sun sets far too early, leaving all to get to know themselves too well.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So here’s to self-determination to an extent, to patience while watching the characters write themselves, and to sleeping on floors.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Best,</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Alex</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">‘Tis the season for resolutions, reflections, and new beginnings. I’m back home for the end of the semester, spending time with family and trying not to feel too guilty about not moving as quickly.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I watched a video last night that talked about the “resistance” of procrastination: there’s the life we live, resistance, and the unlived life within. This concept comes from Steven Pressfield’s <em>The War of Art</em>, a book that I’ve recently added to my bookshelf on a long stack of books to read.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I think I feel imposter syndrome differently than I used to––before, I believed I wasn’t at a certain level or running the long-con of productive image that would eventually fall apart, but now it’s much more clear: the imposter syndrome is based on my internal image as opposed to come grand comparison game. I feel guilt for not being the projected image of myself.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So my new year’s resolutions are anti-resistance. There wil always be the tasks I don’t want to do, but I want to build this structure into routine to affirm myself that I am the person I am projecting.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What does that look like? My main goal is to follow a diligent morning routine without fail. No matter what obstacles lie ahead in the day, at the very least I can say that I started the day off correctly: making my bed, brewing coffee and slowing down, spending time on my hobbies, planning and morphing the day, etc. The actual routine spans an hour and a half, but it is daily time dedicated to refocus.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’m also hoping to turn writing back into a habit. Over my gap year, I would take my old clunky keyboard everywhere––in the car, waiting for a table at a restaurant––and start writing. Now that school is a much larger aspect of my life, I have a harder time introducing my passions in smaller increments, adninstead I feel a surmounting guilt of not writing enough. The same applies for reading: I want to read intentionally and ambitiously.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We are always in control of our time, which means whatever we are doing is something we want to do. If I’m watching YouTube, I want to watch YouTube. But I don’t want to be someone who watches some absurd amount per week. I want to reclaim my time for myself and my creative endeavors. Outside of workflow and life vision resolutions, I want to make a real commitment to reply and be proactive about my relationships with others.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">These reflections are easier to remark upon out of the context of campus. I left school in an odd spot––I took quite a brutal chemistry exam and believed that I sacrificed my grade in the class. This led to quite a terrible mental state. I found myself beating myself up for a result that I didn’t know yet. Of course, after a week of dreadful waiting, I didn’t throw anything away at all. My grade was exactly what I had hoped it would be before the exam, but that didn’t save me from the grief after the exam. It reminded me exactly how much this grade meant to me––not even because I care about being a perfect student, but I had put so much work into this course throughout the semester that I was terrified of throwing it away.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’m going to return to moving slowly for the remainder of the break. But when I step foot on campus, it’s go time––for real.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Here’s to revving up the engine again.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Best,</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Alex</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br><br></p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I'm pretty familiar with metathesis: switching a vowel and a consonant as a Texan. Words like prescription are pronounced prescription, and iron is pronounced iern. Usually, no one stops to correct me, and most times, these words are common enough that no one bats an eye. But there's quite a distinct difference between a slip of the tongue and the evolution of the word.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We don't think about language evolving daily, but we envision it on a large scale: languages trickling down from Sanskrit or Old English, leaving us with our expansive lexicon. I've been thinking a lot about this type of evolution––one that isn't seen but happens under the surface until you travel to a new part of the country and are stunned by just how subtle these changes are, leaving us to imagine what the macro scale must look like.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I've been off to a good start this semester. I've been leaning into a routine and challenging other cyclical elements, but I've found that when I set a habit like reading, I want to spend that time reading for pleasure instead of courses. For example, I'm often tempted to open a scholarly article when my 15-minute reading time begins, but I always find myself drained afterward.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">My problem comes at the end of the day, where the night before, I hope to be as productive as possible the next day, so I schedule hours back to the back of work. As a result, I end each day constantly feeling like I missed something I should have gotten done, putting new meaning to what a 24-hour day means.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Out of both impulse and an urge to be responsible, I recently bought a fish named Bug. I wanted not just a routine for myself but something that immediately felt outside of my world of to-do lists. It's been nothing but a great experience, and this fish is spoiled. Friends come over, listen to the filter's flow, which almost emulates a zen garden, and are reminded of childhood pets and pet store trips. My family tends to avoid pet stores since every time we find ourselves in one; my father always finds a way to walk out with a new animal. Once, I went to a 10-year-old's birthday party, and they picked me up with a dog in hand. I love living in an animal-centered home, but I never realized what I missed when I moved away—a reminder that there is more than second-order desire.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I was cast as the narrator in Into the Woods, which I am equally excited and nervous about. I am thrilled to take on a role in the cast and be a part of Hoof 'n' Horn, but I worry that I've already got too much on my plate. Nevertheless, I am determined to give myself the best chance possible by operating on routine and proactive work rather than reactive work. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I want to take action on self-development more than ever: in the hyper-productive routine sense and inject mindfulness into each task. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I've been a part of rush for selective living groups at Duke, and I'm trying to keep a positive mindset; "no matter what happens," is a mentality that only goes so far. I want to think that I've done everything I can to give myself the best chances possible with genuine interest instead of some suck-up act. But it's hard to both self-evaluate and be evaluated in the same space.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">At the end of the day, I'm around because people want me around; that's not up for me to decide. So it all comes back to control. And somehow, the act of cleaning a fish tank every Sunday leaves me with that illusion of control––I can't complain.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Here's to more evolution.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Best,</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Alex</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I think that feeling behind in life is the best thing that has ever happened. Every morning that I wake up feeling like there was more I could do, more time I could devote to meaningful work, there is an omnipresent drive to be better. That’s a version of success I can get with: raw and meaningful work, regardless of scale. I would much rather find myself than wait for someone else.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As expected, February didn’t last long. I cooked pasta and bread for friends, stressed over midterms, failed, sang, and faithfully celebrated Groundhog Day. I’ve been hard on myself, which brings me to my next topic.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">For most of my productive career, I have focused on intentionally spending each hour of every day. Whether writing assignments or documentary-style YouTube videos, most hours of my day could be considered “productive” until about two hours before bed. I organize my tasks by how long they will take, block out the free time during the week, and play a Jenga game with all of my obligations. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">But for as much as I wish to call myself a productivity master, I’m more of a junkie. There’s a crucial element that I only realized this week; my work isn’t dependent on my time at all. Most days, I’ll get to my 2 hours of focused work in the evening and want to collapse after working for four hours at 6 am. But, on the other hand, I’ve always worked better in the mornings––I don’t have the whole day to dread completing what needs to get done.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So I’m shifting my pedagogy a bit. Time is finite, but energy isn’t. I’ll keep you updated on how that works out, but I have a sinking feeling that time is bound to be challenging to part with.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’ve also had a bit of a career and significant shift over the past month. I came into the fall of my first year planning on double majoring in Classical Languages and Neuroscience with a minor in Classical Archaeology on a pre-health track. However, over the past few weeks, it’s become clear that I’m not destined to become a doctor and subject myself to years of tests and evaluations that would cause more anxiety than needed.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It’s so hard to abandon the dream of medical school. But that’s precisely the problem: it’s a dream. Nothing is clear When I try and foresee my life as a surgeon, nothing is clear; I don’t know if I would be happy. Out of all of my career objectives, coworkers, salary, and fulfillment, the fulfillment is the predecessor. And a neuroscience major for a man who doesn’t want to do research or go to medical school is almost as useless as a Classical Languages degree.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’m doing a big switch with that in mind, not without its anxieties. Duke offers an interdisciplinary major in Computer Science and Linguistics, which I hope to pursue. The only problem? I have no history or experience in computer science or linguistics. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">For some reason, the unexplored territory doesn’t horrify me as much s it seems it should. And I like that. I like that I’m ready to fall on my face working through problem sets and trying to catch up.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Feeling behind pulls my feet ahead. Feeling fulfilled lifts my head up. Heading toward––it’s just the beginning.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Best,</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Alex</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You’re in your twenties now. Do you have it figured out? Am I on <em>the</em> path right now?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There isn’t a big milestone of turning 20. No big party to attend or license to obtain, just texts to reply to and reckonings to, well, reckon with. Birthday cards from grandparents with 20 dollar bills, nods across campus, inquiries about what you’re doing to celebrate.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It is on your 20th birthday that you start to worry you’re growing out of birthdays. It’s when you’re 20 that you start to think about the adult decisions you have to make. It’s on your 20th birthday that you drop the ball one more time.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">March was a month of exploration: of new art, new friends, new schemes, hard songs to write, bread making, book binding, reckonings. Not a month of documentation. Let’s save that for April.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Sometimes it’s easy to turn your life into a metaphor. Other months, it’s harder to get something on the page––to pull out of the mundane.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Until the next reckoning,</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Alex </p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">For someone who performs more than average, it might be surprising that I hate performing. The getting ready and group mentality is always enjoyable, but the minute the pressure lands on me, there’s no one to call line, and you’re asked to give it your best shot in place of your best preparation? That is the peak of self-redundancy: critique the self and simultaneously improve upon it faster than the doubt can seep in.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’m happy I ended up doing Hoof ‘n’ Horn this year––I met quite spectacular people, a few who goof and gaff, and many who were there to lend an ear when I believed I was begging for silence.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I got through some tough classes this semester with flying colors. That outcome was often far from obvious: a 66 on my first neuroscience midterm helped me tie back my passions into a concise and marketable package. Now time to fill the weight behind the bullshit.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I made lots of bread this semester: for parties, Pitchforks rehearsals, quarantine gifts, late night cravings. The recipe itself is not difficult, but rather time consuming, so it also ends up cooking up a bit of a crowd all waiting for the bread to come out of the oven to take that oh-so-precious bite. I like that feeling.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I finished my book for Writing 101, Book. Art. Object., and I really love what I came up with. I’m hoping to continue collecting bits and pieces of future books when I’m in Italy this summer. I like keeping fragments of artistry in my life––feels a little less cookie cutter.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Played lots of board games. Odd elevator rides. New families. Sore arms and legs. And tough goodbyes.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As I’m writing this, I’m looking forward to a fun beach week with some of the people I love most in this world. But I’m also having a hard time passing the time. When it’s fleeting, decisions can be made on a whim, decisions without structure––but when it lulls? You lose the beauty of time running faster than you can catch it.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’m off to pack. Overall, freshman year left me hopeful and resentful: both of past and present, then and now, and whatever else may arrive in an oddly shaped package on the bus.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Until next,</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Alex&nbsp;</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">May was a whirlwind, moving from weeks saying my farewells to my closest friends to finding an odd routine back at home and preparing to head to Italy for three months.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Beach week, a tradition at Duke, was the first time I felt truly present in the past few months. We cooked and shared quite a few laughs, reminisced on a cinematic year, and took our time as each day passed. In high school, it took me two years to really find my people. I’m grateful that process was much faster at Duke. I felt at home.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’m happy that the pandemic brought me the gift of cooking. There’s nothing quite like cooking a meal for the ones you love. The famous ‘Alex Bread’ has found its own plague at Duke, with the opportunity to turn it into a money-making machine. It’ll come in time. At home, I tackled a 3-day croissant recipe for the first time. And the focaccia plus cheese combo (more commonly known as pizza)? It was a hit, to say the least.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When I left campus, I was met with familiar scenery––late nights catching up with parents, the all too alluring endless scroll, and monotonous but somehow comforting feed of content. There’s a dissonance in coming home: it’s almost like reintroducing yourself. I took my time, acknowledging that it was a time of rest, but it’s so hard for me to shake off the feeling of guilt when doing ‘nothing’. I pushed that into songwriting. I don’t write in the same way at home as I do at school. In my dorm, I pick up my guitar when I have to––when there’s not enough to be said but too much to be sung. I pushed myself to get out of the door: to coffeeshops, rock climbing gyms, old streets. I’m reckoning with a new identity. A year ago, I was almost certain I would be a doctor. Now? I am once again seduced by the art of archaeology.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’ll write more as I head into summer, but for now, I rest easy with contentment, eagerly awaiting the next chapter of momentum.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Best,</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Alex </p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Nothing makes me feel more alive than digging. The days are long––I start by dragging myself out of bed at around 5:30 am, and we usually don't get home until around 6:00 pm. That usually means I tend to mentally collapse the minute we get back, but that doesn't mean there isn't dinner to prepare and the next day to set up for. The work is incredible––more than ever, I feel like I am starting to understand the theory behind the archaeology I am doing. The site I am at, Vulci, uses the single context system, a stratigraphy method meant to be the opposite of the old archaeology of plunderers. Each layer is documented meticulously with patience and astute observation from a whole team, experts and novices. I feel like my opinion is sought after, although I am one of the youngest on the site. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Digging makes me feel very present. The only thing to worry about is the unit before you, trying to understand the activities that brought about that pile of dirt. It has also helped me think about the ancients differently. It wasn't just the Etruscans, the Romans, then the medieval: they reused and adapted elements and foundations of old cultures as we still do today. I've started to think about the foundations I have built and what will remain of my spoliation and dirt. It feels good to feel the texture of my hands, eroding them with hidden trash. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Not only am I digging, but Vulci is also unique because of the small team. That means that everyone does a bit of everything, from the analysis and pottery washing to the documentation and stratigraphy matrices. As a result, I've had to internalize what I learned in Orvieto in 2019: it's not a fundamental mistake if you learn from it. More in archaeology than in any other field, the only way to learn is to ask questions from people worldwide who have studied more than you and always feel like a bit of a rookie. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Our field director gave me a trowel and told me that because I was so <em>bravo</em>––her English is improving every day, but my Italian is coming along much more slowly––she wanted me to keep one of the site trowels. The trowel is miles ahead of the one that I got on a whim when I believed archaeology would be a word to describe an odd summer of high school. Each day I'm here, it becomes clearer that to dismiss it so blissfully would be tragic. I can't let this passion go. I've followed passion my whole life, even when it was unheard of for a twelve-year-old kid to self-produce an albeit less than mediocre album. But I did it regardless. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I used to call myself a perfectionist. I don't think that's accurate any longer. I'm not a perfectionist but a go-getter: I'm a master at overloading my plate because I get excited at the swarth of open doors and possible roads. I want to learn, but I also have difficulty forgiving myself when I don't get something right the first time. I work quickly, with lots of shitty first drafts, and I find it hard to find the patience to revise. But after enough first tries, after enough fragments and quick bursts of inspiration, I will often gather the strength to reset and take a step back. It isn't quite a revision, and it's far from perfectionism: it's ambition. I admit that ambition is a blessing and a curse. I often find myself overloaded with projects in which I no longer see life, but I would be remiss to dismiss the joy that ambition has brought me. When I have many doors still open in front of me, and one of them fits? It somehow feels like it was on purpose the whole time.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Over the past few weeks, I've focused on pottery more and more. Studying ceramics never crossed my mind, but I love the details and patience that the process requires: to wash, sort, diagnose, and inventory. While archaeology often leads us to the most apparent remnants of ancient life, such as the decadent temples, mausoleums, and tombs of the aristocrats, pottery was universal throughout most social classes. While some were more valuable than others, you can hold a shard in your hand and think of how many lives it has lived––as cookware, canteens for wine, or small containers for perfume. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I have another three weeks here before I explore some other parts of Italy and return home. Here's to more adventures and more time in the trenches.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Best,</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Alex</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">First and foremost: this marks the end of Year Two and the beginning of Year Three of the Year of Pause project. I’m quite proud of the work that I have produced over the past two years, and I can’t wait to continue onto Year Three. Writing has always served as a way for me to knock on my own door, slow down, check in, evaluate, consider, and live intentionally––that’s how the project started, and that’s how I hope for it to continue.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The last few weeks of the dig were demanding but rewarding; I met more people despite an ever-decreasing language barrier, thanks to my daily practice in Italian. I asked more specific and educated questions about the structure of the excavation and historical context and cooked some more good food. I enjoyed my time at Vulci and hope to return in not too long, even if it’s only for a few weeks.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’ve continued my enthusiasm and curiosity for learning, and I believe it’s at an all-time peak. Nothing makes you feel the perfect kind of stupid like being immersed into an entirely different culture and discipline; my understanding of what archaeology means––documentation for the sake of preservation––has expanded past a methodology. But, of course, that would not have been possible without the excellent team at Vulci, who laughed and taught me as I blurt out jumbled Italian; we, lovingly, say that I speak in Esperanto. And for seven weeks of learning? I’ll take anything that isn’t “stupid American.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There is one person that I’d like to highlight that I didn’t get the chance to last month. Alessandra, whom I can now call a dear friend, ‘la regina,’ and the best Italian mother that I could ask for, immersed me in not only the understanding of ceramics and materials but also educated me about Italian culture, nuances, and quite a few life philosophies that I will continue to learn from for quite some time. She gave me her utmost attention, even when it didn’t seem feasible: when we were behind on inventory, that didn’t stop her from answering my excessive questions about impasto rosso-bruno, and she took extra care towards the end of the excavation that I understood not only <em>what</em> I was doing, but also <em>why</em> I was doing it: the uses, the chronology, etc. She is only one example of a person I met this summer who was invested in my education simply because I was enthusiastic about it.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Laura and Enrico, our field directors, continued to explain over and over which layer covered which, the minuscule differences between the red-brown and the brown layer, the friable and the compact, and they seemed to enjoy seeing the look on my face when I finally understood, which allowed me to dig with never-before-seen confidence. Their patience gave me more knowledge than any textbook could. Moreover, because I was learning from them daily, it opened a new door of professionalism and friendship that I hope to maintain over many years. I watched and tried to understand their Italian conversations about the relationships between layers and why some decisions would be riskier than others. Still, I learned the most from their opened-mindedness: it wasn’t that one person was right, but it was the earth that told the truth.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And I would be remiss not to mention Dylan and Andrew, the fellow Americans who lived with me in Via Tre Cancelli, a quaint home of peace and lots of Best Brau. I watched Andrew study for his Ph.D. archaeology exam, and as he learned by teaching, I learned by being taught. I got to see another lens into the alluring world of academia. I learned many valuable lessons, ranging from ‘drink the juice, Shelby’ to ‘don’t polish a cannonball,’ but most of all, I learned from getting to know them, their stories, and their why’s of archaeology. It’s a pretty crazy thing to do when you think about it––but the crazy people here are the ones I found the most solace in.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Of course, others along the way opened my eyes to another world, such as Rebecca and Margherita, with whom I explored Cerveteri and discussed the classic philosophical problems plaguing us in our twenties. Their patience and willingness to teach me, as with everyone in the dig, made Vulci a bit homey for me. In addition, their persistence in the site, sieve, lab, and late nights at the Birreria encouraged me to take my time.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">After seven weeks of excavating, I didn’t expect a grand revelation, but I hoped to have a few more answers about where I saw myself in the next few years. I am somewhat proud that I don’t have the expected answers. Nevertheless, I am pleased to say that I hope to see myself back in Italy soon, and I realize I have more time than I anticipated.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I enjoyed spending the week alone in Florence, watching Americans stumble about, Italians give odd looks, the many faces that almost look like someone I know, and wandering through side streets searching for the perfect notebook. This time in Florence was an actual vacation: time spent alone dedicated to recharging and exploring on my own accord. One night stands out: as I was returning home to my hotel, I heard a singer singing Chris Stapleton, and it was only natural that I entered, ordered a cocktail, and listened to this Italian sing everything from Johnny Cash to Cat Stevens. While there, I met an American couple who was in Italy for their first wedding anniversary. They asked me about my travels, and I told them about my summer work, ranging from studying materials to implementing GIS and digital archaeology methods. Indeed, my favorite part was when they asked my age––they were immediately taken aback and began their sentences with “I wish…” and “if only…”. It’s good to take a step back through their eyes to re-realize just how lucky I am.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Inevitably, some scheduling adjustments to my plans in the fall regarding coursework have occurred, thrusting me into yet another spiral of doubt about my computer science experience or lack thereof. I’m trying to work through some online courses before I return, but it wasn’t sustainable during the excavation, which has sent me wildly off track. I also worry that when the time comes that I have the tools to create something, it won’t be truly original in a way that I will be satisfied with.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’m excited to see my family in a week or so as I finish the final leg of this trip. But I’m also excited to come home and return to a different sense of tranquility, to see old friends in New York, and of course, to return to my routine-oriented life back at school.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So here’s to diving headfirst into learning, the all-too-familiar impostor syndrome, and unbridled enthusiasm for failure.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Until next,</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Alex</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">After a ski trip that I was mildly unprepared for and a winter break of rest, I’m eager to start the new year after lots of hot chocolate and board games. I’m weary, however, as my stamina tends to diminish exponentially after the first six weeks of school. As such, I hope to find ways to be sustainable and consistent in my habits this year.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Once again, I search for New Year’s Resolutions, from getting fit to reading more, all things I always tell myself I’ll do. However, I’m hoping this year will be different, as I’m adopting a system called the 12-week year that aims to hold me more accountable to myself and make the change as needed. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I also try to shake the guilt of falling off schedule this year. Far too often, I sleep in after a long night of working, and instead of celebrating what I accomplished, I seem to pinch myself for a morning wasted.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Last year, my word was consistency. This year, it’s accountability. Now that I have systems to stay on track and keep up with the buffer work, how can I be proactive in holding myself accountable for my work, relationships, and long-term personal and career goals?&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It all goes to say that many things are left to a roll of the dice, a chance that we take on ourselves. So I’m just hoping I might get lucky if I take that chance every day.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I love my classes starting the semester, from reading Euripides’ <em>Medea</em> in Greek to Computer Architecture. It will be a demanding course load with many small and large-scale deadlines, but I hope to find ways to give myself as much buffer as possible. Especially as I start considering future thesis topic ideas, I have been using my Notion religiously to store the tiny seeds that I come up with that might one day turn into a year’s project. My biggest fear is that I won’t be original in my findings, and especially in a field such as classics, it’s hard to be the first to say something. So the other pivot is instead of approaching it as having to carry the burden of coming up with something original, which is quite rare and not necessarily an indicator of quality, instead focus on coming up with a new way of saying something that has been noted for many hundreds of years. To be determined.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The biggest goal I’m hoping to reach is to find an internship in computer science, specifically within software engineering. However, after 93 applications, I’ve only heard half-hearted rejections as I find myself in an internship pool with far more respectable applicants. It’s difficult to shake the feeling of imposter syndrome as I scramble together miscellaneous projects that I’ve started and hoped to finish to prove to an online application that I am somehow qualified.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The secret is that you don’t have to be qualified, but I’m tired of trying to prove myself over a screen. The process makes me anxious to find a job upon graduation. No matter what, the option to return to digging always remains open, like an alluring light at the end of the tunnel. I am heartbroken at the reality: to make a change in a field like archaeology, not only does it take a tremendous amount of additional schooling, but I want to apply new software and technology to an area without funding and the broad challenge scale. I want my job title to be one that no one has done yet.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The pull back and forth between archaeology and computer science, especially as I approach over a hundred software internship applications and have yet to be successful. It almost feels impossible to convince someone over a screen that I’m a qualified and eager student. Still, I aim to stay hopeful, especially as more applications come out in the spring.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So how do I train or educate myself to be someone I don’t know? That, again, is another door that remains far too open at twenty years old. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So without further ado, I have an outline of what the next few years look like for me. Of course, this is just a plan, and plans are meant to change, but here’s the blueprint, at least:</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span class="sqsrte-text-highlight" data-text-attribute-id="d9db99f7-22f9-491a-acb8-d3bcc03c39f5"><strong>Long Term Vision</strong></span> to be accomplished in the next five years:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Spend a substantial amount of time in Italy. Why? Because I find myself learning at a far faster pace when I am in a culture of exploration. </p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Become entirely financially independent and develop a system to ensure personal financial success. This will help with shaking the sense of panic.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Grow intellectual pursuits and creations through reading, writing, and singing. I want to find a sustainable way to keep creativity in my life throughout my twenties and hopefully further.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As I continue to share my goals, remember that they are meant to stack upon each other.</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Learn Italian proficiently. I want to find ways to make language acquisition second nature through daily grammar and vocabulary reviews and conversations with my Italian friends at least once a week.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Build a habit of reading for both creative and professional endeavors. For example, if I plan on continuing to create, I want to explore new content almost constantly, from books to podcasts to video essays.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Develop a passive income. This is tied to my financial independence. In the past, I’ve found ways to do freelance work, from editing, writing, revising, and tutoring, but I want to build a small branch of passive income projects that I can watch steadily grow and improve throughout its distribution.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Implement a sustainable long-term financial system. I want to build a timeline with a number in mind after my first internship and block out how much money or percentage of my income I want to keep invested, saved, and budgeted. </p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Get a fulfilling career in Computer Science. I love this field––I love the creativity that computers offer, and I want to work for a curious, collaborative, and motivated company.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Get fit. Especially as I grow into my early twenties, I want to build good habits of taking care of my body. The biggest reward of this goal is the impact that working out has on my sleep––I end up falling asleep far faster and sleeping at a far higher quality.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Create compelling discography. I want to continue making music in a sustainable fashion that operates as a creative outlet.</p></li></ul>

<hr />

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>So that brings us to today.</strong> I’ve got a lot on my plate, but it’s because I believe the career-entry phase of my life will prove critical. Think of jobs like a ladder: if I can start at a higher rank, I’ll be able to continually chase the most challenging opportunities and open as many doors as possible.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’ve also implemented smaller goals, such as not looking at my phone as often, especially when walking. In the past, I used the time between classes to drill flashcards or clear out my inbox, but I want to focus on being more present, especially in these passing moments.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">How do we set goals without kicking ourselves for each day that seems to pass by without success? How do I one day decide that I’m going to take my life into my own hands, with each minute more precious than the last? </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It all starts with a mindset. A mindset that every step I take in the right direction is one less step I’ll have to take later on. So even if a few nights are long and mornings are shorter than expected, I still have a few things to knock off a to-do list that bring me closer to my goals.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">&nbsp;So for the first 13 weeks of the year, I’ll be targeting my focus on a few goals:</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, internships. There are a few steps I’ll have to take to find a position.</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Five a Day till Payday: Every day, I aim to apply to at least five internships and build and revise my application materials as needed. This involves a comprehensive resume review, an ever-changing cover letter, and joining communities that may open doors to opportunities. In addition, I am pursuing content creation by uploading my daily progress on TikTok @progressofpause.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Thirty minutes a day of LeetCode: LeetCode is a platform that hosts traditional Data Structures and Algorithms problems that are used in internship technical interviews. These problems are dry and meticulous, but I must practice them. In addition to my daily practice, I’m taking a course at Duke that corresponds to this type of work. </p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Emails to Alumni: For a dedicated amount of time each week, I’ll be making direct connections with Duke and Exeter alums searching for informational interviews about software engineering. I’m hoping this will give me a better perspective.</p></li></ul><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finance. I’ll be starting with financial awareness by…</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">tracking my daily spending in a Google sheet. I’m also developing my investment calendar for this year, aiming to save 8,000 in 2023. Again, I’m uniquely positioned to do this at a time in my life without rent, grocery trips, etc. </p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">building a 20-year calendar to reach 1,000,000 in investments by 35. This sounds daunting, but I should be on a trajectory if I can make consistent dollar-cost-averaging deposits into relatively secure funds. Of course, again, much of this compound interest depends on the market's health, but since I’m a long-term investor, I’m changing my perspective from value to simply # of shares.</p></li></ul><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blog: 10 minutes a day of writing</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This is what I’m doing right now! I fell off of this project during the fall, and since I didn’t take intentional time to devote to writing, I found myself writing only once every month or so. Writing gives me the magnifying glass of my life and opens the doors to daily introspection. I’m also spending an hour a week developing “snapshots” of the months I missed.</p></li></ul><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fitness: Weigh-in and Work Out 2x/a wk</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This one might seem small to the fitness buffs, but I haven’t worked out consistently since last spring. I’ve designated days in the week when I have more flexibility and re-implemented rigidity by scheduling workouts. I’m not focused on weight loss but rather on overall strength. It’s also a massive plus that working out increases my sleep quality. </p></li></ul><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notion: 1 hr/wk of Brainstorm</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I plan to create a storefront later in the year, but I want to dedicate time to thinking about what tools I use often and how to provide those resources to others. </p></li></ul><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This month, along with being a big month of resolutions, is also when I’m undergoing an extensive medical process to freeze my eggs. It sounds about as luxurious as it sounds. Medications shoved in syringes and fridges, timed within far too precise intervals. I’m eager to start the process since more haste gives the illusion that the process will be shorter. I’m also worried about sharing this process with the outside world, as after I freeze my eggs, I will start hormone replacement therapy. That’s a scary thing to share––I know this is the right decision for my health, but it’s hard to explain <em>how</em> I know it’s the right decision. How do you explain to someone that you know you’re a man? It’s not about liking trucks or being a powerful force but about feeling at home in my own body. It’s about feeling like myself. I hope to get to the bottom of this by writing my way through it.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Humankind is bound to face the problem of immortality any year now––with startup CEOs pledging to donate their brains to computers to build AI networks; we have romanticized the preserved, believing that the intellect we have now will be worth keeping. However, I don’t think our brains make us human­––I believe we do. We have senses, breaths, and grief––all of which, while they incorporate the brain, it’s difficult for me to fathom as the only factor. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It's tough because I don’t believe in an immortal soul, as Socrates claimed, but we have <em>a priori </em>knowledge. So, where does it come from? In my opinion, it’s immersion. Immersion from parents and caretakers at a young age teaches you there is beauty in imprecision––a stool is a type of chair, and a chair is a type of seat. We understand so much implicitly that it’s essential to know why we can make sense of the larger picture through small steps of reason.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Writing is more complicated when I’m not reading. I’m less present and less aware of my perspective of the world when I don’t have reading material to make my life feel more extensive. I’m trying to keep books in my ears while walking down the path to class––I’m listening to <em>Homo Deus</em>, which brings the larger scale of what humanity might be up to in the background.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In my Latin class, we read Horace’s Odes 1.11, the poem famously known as the <em>carpe diem</em>. It had a far different context than expected. I always interpreted <em>carpe diem</em> as ‘seize the day,’ an imperative proclamation to ensure that each day is taken without dismissal. While the original poem is similar, there are significant differences, namely that it doesn’t quite mean ‘seize the day’ but ‘pluck the day’ almost. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br></p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I don’t believe in trusting the future; this year, I’m focusing on trusting each day as its present moment. I’m trying to take small things each day, consistently, to build up habits that make the most of each day. It’s hard for me to commit a significant amount of time to projects that don’t feel pressing, so instead, I’m aiming to make the priority just a few pieces every day.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It’s hard to build the courage to stab yourself with a needle. I thought being an EMT would shake the nerves out of me, but it’s an entirely different thing to feel yourself on the other side of the needle, like tickling yourself. It’s a feeling that I’m getting a little too used to, but before each injection, my hand still hovers over the injection site for at least fifteen seconds. A few deep breaths and a quick look away will do the trick. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’m still petrified of messing something up in this process, possibly hurting a future opportunity to have kids. There are many ways to have kids, through adoption or a surrogate, but at 20 years old, it’s hard for me to understand or visualize what that future looks like. Kids are expensive, and while I’m sure the joy of being a parent is not something I have not fully grasped, it’s hard for me to envision that especially regarding my financial goals.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The financial goals feel scary in themselves. I don’t know exactly what I’m saving for since I’m still figuring out the next five years, whether for rent in a city I’ve never been to or graduate school tuition. I’m still figuring out how the puzzle pieces fit together.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So here’s to solving it.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Until next,&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Alex<br><br></p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I struggle with failure days. Days that my body gives up on me. I find it hard to have the grace to acknowledge that health comes before work and shake off the oh-so-dreaded guilt. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br>Today starts a phase of my life I have been waiting for almost six years now. Everything will stay the same; no leaves fall on autumn's first day. It takes you looking up and wishing for them to fall, making the time seem more drastic.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We are bad at waiting. We find ways to fill time rather than watch it pass. It’s always easier to be doing, thinking, dreaming, and pursuing than to sit idly and wait.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">After my procedure, I’ve been dealing with pain management, drinking almost countless bottles of white Gatorade, and sitting curled up holding a heating pad. Being in pain like that makes me angry, which is not a feeling I’m used to, but I become frustrated that my body limits what I can push myself to do. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And with that, I’ve fallen of the habit of applying every day. Now that I’ve stopped for a week, I’m trying to figure out how to get back on best. After around 200 applications, I wonder how to use my time best. But right now, I’m using that as an excuse to do nothing.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’ve been accepted not to any internship but to a few mentee positions. But the push and pull between software and archaeology are starting to add more stress rather than just an interdisciplinary quirk.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I must have manifested something in the universe yesterday when I wrote that message. Finally, I got accepted to a program that will compensate me and allow me to work on a larger project, Duke’s Code+ program. This is exciting news for someone like me with little experience, but the downside is that it overlaps entirely with the Vulci excavation.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I told Alessandra first. She once again invited me to the Palatine. I’m telling myself that this summer is my exploration into software, to build and break projects for at least an hour a day. But I wouldn't say I like to explore it; I must abandon the excavation unless I were to take a gap semester, inevitably pushing back my graduation a semester. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And, of course, now there are logistics to figure out, where to live, how I’ll drive, and all sorts of fun adult stuff. I’m just grateful the search is over, but I’ll still apply to projects within the classics world to ensure I can keep my toe in that oh-so-alluring pond.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">On exam day, I am much more aware of my body. Tension in my back, numbness at the bottom of my sinuses, and a few more pimples appear just in time for picture day.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">But as exams pass and a moment of lull washes over, I try to keep the urgency I felt, try not to think about what I answered for the last actual false question, and keep that momentum moving.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Now that I’ve been accepted into a program, I find it harder to continue pushing my motivation through challenging classes and career decisions.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The exams went well. The projects that everyone else has been able to complete without breaking down? Not so much. I have such a hard time building a program incrementally; I want to rush and implement it all, even to my detriment. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I spent far too many all-nighters for a project that needed to be understood deeply rather than grinding it out hour by hour. But I’m now back to the typical state of affairs, outlining papers and ensuring I’m not missing any sneaky deadlines.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Reflecting on this time of transition and uncertainty, I am reminded of the importance of being kind to ourselves and taking the time to rest and recharge. In our fast-paced lives, it can be all too easy to become consumed by work or school demands and neglect our physical and mental health. However, by prioritizing self-care, we can ensure that we remain healthy, happy, and fulfilled in our personal and professional lives. So while I am excited to continue pursuing my passions and exploring new opportunities, I am also committed to finding a sustainable balance that allows me to take care of myself and prioritize my well-being.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">With that being said, here’s to a beautifully gloomy February, filled with moments of rest and reflection and the courage to prioritize self-care even amid uncertainty and transitions. May we all find the strength to be kind to ourselves and prioritize our well-being, and continue to pursue our passions and explore new opportunities with a sense of balance and perspective. Here's to a brighter future, one step at a time.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Until next month,</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Alex</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’ve had a hard time keeping a balance this year. That’s not for a lack of joy or enrichment––I’ve always got a lot going on all at the same time. But as I reevaluate priorities every season, the habit of writing is one that I always find myself coming back to.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It’s New Year’s resolution season, so I’ll reflect on what I set out to achieve:</p><h3 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">Goals, 2023</span></h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">Learn Italian proficiently: I’ve made steady progress on this goal, but I hope to increase my active engagement by pursuing lessons or taking an online course with an instructor. My proficiency in writing and reading has far surpassed my ability to speak simply due to a lack of practice.</span></p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">Build a habit of reading for both creative and professional endeavors: I have exercised this muscle, but this was a challenging goal to make a SMART goal for me––I read more books than last year thanks to my Kindle, but I have a hard time either completing a book or being able to focus my interest on a wide range of genres.</span></p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">Develop a passive income: I realize this goal was a bit disillusioned, as passive income is far more of a myth than is portrayed online. Actively seeking it out as a goal is less effective than chasing the passions that drive those sources of less-active income.</span></p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">Implement a sustainable long-term financial system: I succeeded in this goal far more than I ever expected. I got on a budget this year and received a granularity in my finances, making me not stress about money for the first time. This, along with other adulting things like doing the math to max out my Roth IRA and open a HYSA, has been an incredible foundation to start on, and I can’t wait for my older self to pat myself on the back.</span></p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">Get a fulfilling career in Computer Science: I’m happy to say that I’ll be working at Disney Streaming this summer as a Product Management Intern. Not only am I thrilled to be working at a company like Disney, but more importantly, I’m genuinely excited to tackle the challenging problems in Product––after many months of rejection emails and 258 applications, I’m grateful that the position that I landed is one that I’m excited to contribute to.</span></p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">Get fit: This one has been harder for me. While I thrive on routine, the gym is always the first to fall off and the hardest to start again. I think this year, to continue on this goal, I will allow myself to be more flexible with my schedule––if I miss the 7:00 am wake-up alarm, that shouldn’t mean that going to the gym is off the table.</span></p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">Create compelling discography: I’ve been writing less prolific songs than in the past. Part of this has been due to the changes in my voice––the progressions that used to feel like muscle memory now feel like a far-fetched stretch, and I’m still learning to adapt. And while the volume of my work this year is far less than in the past, I’m proud of the quality of the work that I have produced.</span></p></li></ul><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Before you think I’m another machiavellian maniac, these goals never truly happened in concurrence with one another––I spent a lot of this year on a heavily irregular sleep schedule, struggling to balance my priorities, and taking courses that I felt largely unqualified for, calling for extra study groups and acts of desperation to understand a sliver of a concept. However, with all that being said, before writing out this list, I felt that I underperformed this year, but I think it’s hard to make that argument. While I didn’t hit all of these goals, I believe I am in a more sustainable place, surrounded by people I care about, and have made substantial progress toward my long-term goals.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Without further ado, let’s set some benchmarks that I may or may not be disappointed by this time next year:</p><h3 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">Goals, 2024</span></h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Hit some financial milestones: Now that I have some data, I plan to continue building the muscle of saving early and often. While some of these are lofty goals, even if I don’t hit them all at 100%, I’ll still be able to thank myself later; but now, I can think about metrics like saving rate, investing a certain amount, or increasing net worth, with varying degrees of control.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Build and break projects: After getting my internship, I told myself many of my stressors had fallen by the wayside. My main focuses are school, Pitchforks, and something to be determined. I’d like to be proactive about filling that time with fulfilling work, and I’ve got many projects I hope to build. I want to develop a Budget Wrapped, flesh out the EdStem Bot idea, and gain more practice with active interrogation with NLP methodologies.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Read 25 books: I’m hoping that this goal will be easy with the load of my courses, but I’m also pushing myself to find what I love and hate about particular parts of literature versus feeling indifferent or more of a nomad when it comes to genre.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Write consistently, for the sake of knowing myself: Another priority that I want to focus on this year is the act of writing––it’s something that I love to do and am grateful that I do, but I never feel too eager to start writing on a blank page. I want to get used to that uncomfortable feeling.</p></li></ul><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And, as usual, with each of these goals, here are the strategies I plan to use to build these goals into my life.</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Financial milestones: On a broad scale, I hope to continue saving as much as possible, but I also want to work on the mental side of saving for something––Ben from YNAB talks about the idea that <a href="https://www.ynab.com/blog/no-such-thing-as-savings"><span style="text-decoration:underline">there’s no such thing as saving money</span></a>, but instead we allocate money for a purpose. That money will be spent eventually, just not immediately. I want to work on defining my priorities in my budget to ensure that I can genuinely save for the milestones I want to hit, whether it be investment or travel goals.&nbsp;</p></li><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The most significant financial obligation I’ll have this year is to save for the summer––I’ll be living in Santa Monica, which is more expensive than my life in Durham.</p></li></ul><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Build and break milestones: I aim to flesh out my prototypes for both the Budget Wrapped and the EdStem bot by Spring Break, and I plan to do this by spending at least three hours a week on these projects. This goal seems lofty, but I intend to treat each project as a course and create a pseudo-syllabus.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Read 25 books: This one is just math––aim to finish about two books per month. But I’d like to do a lot of the heavy lifting of figuring out what to read ahead of time; I never want the “but I don’t know what book I want to read” to override the will to read.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Write consistently: I will implement this in my 10-minute-per-day routine; it turns what can seem a daunting habit into a sustainable one, pushing me to write posts like this. I will not pressure my writing but let it be what it is and review my style quarterly to set goals for myself. But for now, let’s get some words on the page.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’ve also spent much of this break with my family, exploring Italy with them and reclaiming the childhood joy of Christmas. But while I stretch to feel those childhood feelings, it’s only because the world is feeling all the more adult; I’ve just found a housing arrangement for working in Santa Monica this summer, which still feels like a fever dream, along with finding our senior year house with three of my best friends. I feel myself on the other side of the halfway point, and it’s not that I regret anything; instead, I fret over what I might miss in the future.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I can’t make this technically a goal since it’s hard, or rather, feels superficial, to set benchmarks for this, but I hope to spend more time with friends over this next year. Sometimes, it hits me that I’ve only got a year and a half left at Duke––a place where I’ve had a love-hate relationship but has ultimately seen my most prominent years of growth, many of my what-am-I-doing-with-my-life crises and has brought me to meet mentors who I hope to stay in touch with for as long as I have an itch of intellectual curiosity.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I haven’t leaned into the Duke that many people know; I rarely go to any Greek party, I have taken classes with only one other student and the professor, and I’ve always preferred having friends all across campus rather than from one pot. However, the Duke that I know, the mornings at Bella Union with Elliot and Rob, stumbling around exploring the Duke Gardens, and staying past when the doors lock in Biddle Music Building, is one that I will surely miss. It’s hard to distinguish whether I’ll miss that purely because it’s Duke or because these are my defined college years when I’m encouraged to do all the explorations that enrich me. And, of course, it’s not the physical campus that holds the weight of the sentimental value for me but the people I surround myself with.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As usual, I am starting the year with far more stamina than I know is realistic to anticipate. However, I hope that building a buffer or setting an unrealistic standard helps me see and understand the benefits of hitting the daily benchmarks. My overarching goal is to develop my muscle of saying “no,” honing in on what’s important to me and treating my projects with the same respect I would treat others.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I work in a way that requires the slightest uphill movement; most of that behavior is initiated by Notion databases, a meticulous Google Calendar, and operating on my timeline. I have a strong over-reliance on digital tools––sure, I could build a system that acts in place of this “Second Brain” model, but there always hits a point in the semester where I am reduced to an Expo marker and a whiteboard when the panic truly sets in.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">That panic has set in, but it’s a different tone this time––it’s not because I’m behind in work, but I’m planning for the next six months, and there remain many unknowns that I’m having trouble accounting for. In these moments of planning and forecasting, a deep, guttural discomfort stems from the unknown––I know my capabilities as the captain, and I trust my vessel. Yet, the opacity of the fog makes it difficult to plot my course confidently. I’m still learning to embrace this.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The cold has finally hit Durham, almost as karma as I bragged to my parents a week ago that it was warmer here than in Texas. I’ve tried to dress to match the occasion––usually, when it’s cold, I throw on a sweatshirt and sweatpants, but that tends to drive me right to the emotional state I aim to avoid, some sense of complacency and intuition that nature is against me, a self-building excuse. Today, I put on a quarter-zip and boots, eager to show professionalism, not to impress anyone, but rather to show myself that there’s no reason to sulk back. I’ll always prefer rainy to cold weather––I love feeling when the rain hits my skin and watching it sag into the grass.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As I continue my career in counseling younger students on how to manage my time, I am constantly forced to reckon with holding myself to my word––I know that I likely get more done than the average person, and that’s not to be boastful, but instead to claim that this still hasn’t hit an internal benchmark. I’ve always believed that work fills the space you allocate it; even if you know you <em>could </em>finish a problem in an hour if you have three hours to finish it, and often, even when I lie to myself about having limited time, I still operate subconsciously on a more generous timetable.&nbsp;<br><br>Best,</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Alex</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It took about three weeks to fall back into the rhythm that I’m a little too all familiar with. I kept saying yes––a lesson I’ve learned a few too many times during this project.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I think it would be a bit generous to describe myself as stretched-thin at this point, and I’m once again reminded that there’s a clear distinction between delegation and dependency.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The tone of my writing so far might lead you to believe that my perspective is pessimistic––it’s quite the opposite: when I sit to work on whatever it may be is up next on my list, I’m excited at the chance to show up for myself, and for the project that I’m contributing to.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">That said, I wanted to show up for myself by writing at least a bit and giving a bit of a life update, even though I’ve done a poor job of maintaining this habit. When I stop writing, it makes it all the harder to spend even a few minutes a day putting my thoughts to paper––unlike what I remarked last month, this task feels uphill.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Nevertheless, the past few weeks have been hectic, filled with passion projects––note, not the ones that I had planned to work on in January, but lots of delving headfirst into schoolwork, letting myself sit with a problem in my algorithms class for longer than necessarily <em>needed</em>, but as long as I felt content with it. I’ve had a lot of moments of meaningful work this month, but again, an emphasis on a lot.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Until next month,</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Best,</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Alex</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I have relished working with brutally honest people this month–typically, that’s taken as a bad thing, but I think I’ve come to learn that I thrive on direct feedback.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’m almost tired of writing that I have a lot on my plate, and I’m once again kicking myself for the goals I set at the beginning of this semester. I will say that this month, I’ve done a much better job of keeping track of all the monkeys in my circus, but I’m still struggling with saying no, as always.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’ve had a lot of fun looking forward to this summer, planning out all of the logistics, but I am filled with a sense of dread when thinking about moving all of my stuff out and out of a dorm for the final time. This is my seventh year of living in a dorm, and I think it’s an understatement to say that I’m ready to graduate from this stage of life. I’m looking forward to my kitchen and building a space that is not just for storage but for settling.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I hit a significant financial milestone, this goal that should, theoretically, compel me to slow my pace regarding the rat race of income. Of course, the only problem is that I’ve built that habit almost to the point that it's ingrained in my psyche. The problem with financial goals is that the goalpost always moves. When it comes to academics, you aim for an A. My career is a little more flexible––I strive to work with genuinely curious people in a challenging environment. However, with personal finance, I could aim to hit $X in net worth or X months in savings, but once that milestone is hit, I am immediately looking at the next goal post.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I will say that building these automated financial structures in my life has made me better at not just organizing a calendar but also my life priorities––gifts for my sister and mom’s birthday, being proactive about opportunities, and building projects that I’m passionate about. That includes developing a House Course on Full-Stack Development, a skill I’ve acquired over the past year. I’m excited to work with students in a different way than I typically do as a tutor or a TA, but instead, focusing my energy on building their passion for their projects.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’ve made a more intentional effort to reach out to friends from years ago, narrowing the scope of where I hope to live on the East Coast. I like the idea of hopping on a plane and going to Boston or New York, even if I don’t necessarily see my life there. I’m stuck in limbo between wanting a fast-paced life and being able to truly clock out of my busyness by immersing myself.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I turned 22 this month and spent some time with my partner and some friends, debriefing life and our respective woes. I used to be a huge “it’s my birthday” guy, but this year, even my boss reminded me that I had to celebrate.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">With that, I’m off to celebrate my wins this month and look forward to the final 20-something days of the semester before heading off to California and moving out of a dorm for the last time.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Best,</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Alex&nbsp;</p>
